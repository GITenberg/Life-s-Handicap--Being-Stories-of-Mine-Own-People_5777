    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Northern India stood a monastery called The Chubara of Dhunni Bhagat.
      No one remembered who or what Dhunni Bhagat had been. He had lived his
      life, made a little money and spent it all, as every good Hindu should do,
      on a work of piety&mdash;the Chubara. That was full of brick cells, gaily
      painted with the figures of Gods and kings and elephants, where worn-out
      priests could sit and meditate on the latter end of things; the paths were
      brick paved, and the naked feet of thousands had worn them into gutters.
      Clumps of mangoes sprouted from between the bricks; great pipal trees
      overhung the well-windlass that whined all day; and hosts of parrots tore
      through the trees. Crows and squirrels were tame in that place, for they
      knew that never a priest would touch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wandering mendicants, charm-sellers, and holy vagabonds for a hundred
      miles round used to make the Chubara their place of call and rest.
      Mahomedan, Sikh, and Hindu mixed equally under the trees. They were old
      men, and when man has come to the turnstiles of Night all the creeds in
      the world seem to him wonderfully alike and colourless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gobind the one-eyed told me this. He was a holy man who lived on an island
      in the middle of a river and fed the fishes with little bread pellets
      twice a day. In flood-time, when swollen corpses stranded themselves at
      the foot of the island, Gobind would cause them to be piously burned, for
      the sake of the honour of mankind, and having regard to his own account
      with God hereafter. But when two-thirds of the island was torn away in a
      spate, Gobind came across the river to Dhunni Bhagat&rsquo;s Chubara, he and his
      brass drinking vessel with the well-cord round the neck, his short
      arm-rest crutch studded with brass nails, his roll of bedding, his big
      pipe, his umbrella, and his tall sugar-loaf hat with the nodding peacock
      feathers in it. He wrapped himself up in his patched quilt made of every
      colour and material in the world, sat down in a sunny corner of the very
      quiet Chubara, and, resting his arm on his short-handled crutch, waited
      for death. The people brought him food and little clumps of marigold
      flowers, and he gave his blessing in return. He was nearly blind, and his
      face was seamed and lined and wrinkled beyond belief, for he had lived in
      his time which was before the English came within five hundred miles of
      Dhunni Bhagat&rsquo;s Chubara.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we grew to know each other well, Gobind would tell me tales in a
      voice most like the rumbling of heavy guns over a wooden bridge. His tales
      were true, but not one in twenty could be printed in an English book,
      because the English do not think as natives do. They brood over matters
      that a native would dismiss till a fitting occasion; and what they would
      not think twice about a native will brood over till a fitting occasion:
      then native and English stare at each other hopelessly across great gulfs
      of miscomprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said Gobind one Sunday evening, &lsquo;is your honoured craft, and
      by what manner of means earn you your daily bread?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a kerani&mdash;one who writes with a pen upon paper, not
      being in the service of the Government.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what do you write?&rsquo; said Gobind. &lsquo;Come nearer, for I cannot see your
      countenance, and the light fails.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I write of all matters that lie within my understanding, and of many that
      do not. But chiefly I write of Life and Death, and men and women, and Love
      and Fate according to the measure of my ability, telling the tale through
      the mouths of one, two, or more people. Then by the favour of God the
      tales are sold and money accrues to me that I may keep alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; said Gobind. &lsquo;That is the work of the bazar story-teller; but
      he speaks straight to men and women and does not write anything at all.
      Only when the tale has aroused expectation, and calamities are about to
      befall the virtuous, he stops suddenly and demands payment ere he
      continues the narration. Is it so in your craft, my son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of such things when a tale is of great length, and is sold
      as a cucumber, in small pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, I was once a famed teller of stories when I was begging on the road
      between Koshin and Etra; before the last pilgrimage that ever I took to
      Orissa. I told many tales and heard many more at the rest-houses in the
      evening when we were merry at the end of the march. It is in my heart that
      grown men are but as little children in the matter of tales, and the
      oldest tale is the most beloved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your people that is truth,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;But in regard to our people
      they desire new tales, and when all is written they rise up and declare
      that the tale were better told in such and such a manner, and doubt either
      the truth or the invention thereof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what folly is theirs!&rsquo; said Gobind, throwing out his knotted hand. &lsquo;A
      tale that is told is a true tale as long as the telling lasts. And of
      their talk upon it&mdash;you know how Bilas Khan, that was the prince of
      tale-tellers, said to one who mocked him in the great rest-house on the
      Jhelum road: &ldquo;Go on, my brother, and finish that I have begun,&rdquo; and he who
      mocked took up the tale, but having neither voice nor manner for the task
      came to a standstill, and the pilgrims at supper made him eat abuse and
      stick half that night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, but with our people, money having passed, it is their right; as we
      should turn against a shoeseller in regard to shoes if those wore out. If
      ever I make a book you shall see and judge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the parrot said to the falling tree, Wait, brother, till I fetch a
      prop!&rsquo; said Gobind with a grim chuckle. &lsquo;God has given me eighty years,
      and it may be some over. I cannot look for more than day granted by day
      and as a favour at this tide. Be swift.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what manner is it best to set about the task.&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;O chiefest of
      those who string pearls with their tongue?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do I know? Yet&rsquo;&mdash;he thought for a little&mdash;&lsquo;how should I not
      know? God has made very many heads, but there is only one heart in all the
      world among your people or my people. They are children in the matter of
      tales.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But none are so terrible as the little ones, if a man misplace a word, or
      in a second telling vary events by so much as one small devil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, I also have told tales to the little ones, but do thou this&mdash;&rsquo; 
      His old eyes fell on the gaudy paintings of the wall, the blue and red
      dome, and the flames of the poinsettias beyond. &lsquo;Tell them first of those
      things that thou hast seen and they have seen together. Thus their
      knowledge will piece out thy imperfections. Tell them of what thou alone
      hast seen, then what thou hast heard, and since they be children tell them
      of battles and kings, horses, devils, elephants, and angels, but omit not
      to tell them of love and suchlike. All the earth is full of tales to him
      who listens and does not drive away the poor from his door. The poor are
      the best of tale-tellers; for they must lay their ear to the ground every
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After this conversation the idea grew in my head, and Gobind was pressing
      in his inquiries as to the health of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when we had been parted for months, it happened that I was to go
      away and far off, and I came to bid Gobind good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is farewell between us now, for I go a very long journey,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I also. A longer one than thou. But what of the book?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be born in due season if it is so ordained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would I could see it,&rsquo; said the old man, huddling beneath his quilt.
      &lsquo;But that will not be. I die three days hence, in the night, a little
      before the dawn. The term of my years is accomplished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In nine cases out of ten a native makes no miscalculation as to the day of
      his death. He has the foreknowledge of the beasts in this respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then thou wilt depart in peace, and it is good talk, for thou hast said
      that life is no delight to thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is a pity that our book is not born. How shall I know that there
      is any record of my name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I promise, in the forepart of the book, preceding everything
      else, that it shall be written, Gobind, sadhu, of the island in the river
      and awaiting God in Dhunni Bhagat&rsquo;s Chubara, first spoke of the book,&rsquo; 
      said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And gave counsel&mdash;an old man&rsquo;s counsel. Gobind, son of Gobind of the
      Chumi village in the Karaon tehsil, in the district of Mooltan. Will that
      be written also?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be written also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the book will go across the Black Water to the houses of your people,
      and all the Sahibs will know of me who am eighty years old?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All who read the book shall know. I cannot promise for the rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is good talk. Call aloud to all who are in the monastery, and I will
      tell them this thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They trooped up, faquirs, sadhus, sunnyasis, byragis, nihangs, and
      mullahs, priests of all faiths and every degree of raggedness, and Gobind,
      leaning upon his crutch, spoke so that they were visibly filled with envy,
      and a white-haired senior bade Gobind think of his latter end instead of
      transitory repute in the mouths of strangers. Then Gobind gave me his
      blessing and I came away.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tales have been collected from all places, and all sorts of people,
      from priests in the Chubara, from Ala Yar the carver, Jiwun Singh the
      carpenter, nameless men on steamers and trains round the world, women
      spinning outside their cottages in the twilight, officers and gentlemen
      now dead and buried, and a few, but these are the very best, my father
      gave me. The greater part of them have been published in magazines and
      newspapers, to whose editors I am indebted; but some are new on this side
      of the water, and some have not seen the light before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable stories are, of course, those which do not appear&mdash;for
      obvious reasons.

    <h2>
      THE LANG MEN O&rsquo; LARUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; CO.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief Engineer&rsquo;s sleeping suit was of yellow striped with blue, and
      his speech was the speech of Aberdeen. They sluiced the deck under him,
      and he hopped on to the ornamental capstan, a black pipe between his
      teeth, though the hour was not seven of the morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever hear o&rsquo; the Lang Men o&rsquo; Larut?&rsquo; he asked when the Man from
      Orizava had finished a story of an aboriginal giant discovered in the
      wilds of Brazil. There was never story yet passed the lips of teller, but
      the Man from Orizava could cap it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, we never did,&rsquo; we responded with one voice. The Man from Orizava
      watched the Chief keenly, as a possible rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not telling the story for the sake of talking merely,&rsquo; said the
      Chief, &lsquo;but as a warning against betting, unless you bet on a perrfect
      certainty. The Lang Men o&rsquo; Larut were just a certainty. I have had talk
      wi&rsquo; them. Now Larut, you will understand, is a dependency, or it may be an
      outlying possession, o&rsquo; the island o&rsquo; Penang, and there they will get you
      tin and manganese, an&rsquo; it mayhap mica, and all manner o&rsquo; meenerals. Larut
      is a great place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what about the population?&rsquo; said the Man from Orizava.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The population,&rsquo; said the Chief slowly, &lsquo;were few but enorrmous. You must
      understand that, exceptin&rsquo; the tin-mines, there is no special inducement
      to Europeans to reside in Larut. The climate is warm and remarkably like
      the climate o&rsquo; Calcutta; and in regard to Calcutta, it cannot have escaped
      your obsairvation that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calcutta isn&rsquo;t Larut; and we&rsquo;ve only just come from it,&rsquo; protested the
      Man from Orizava. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a meteorological department in Calcutta, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, but there&rsquo;s no meteorological department in Larut. Each man is a law
      to himself. Some drink whisky, and some drink brandipanee, and some drink
      cocktails&mdash;vara bad for the coats o&rsquo; the stomach is a cocktail&mdash;and
      some drink sangaree, so I have been credibly informed; but one and all
      they sweat like the packing of piston-head on a fourrteen-days&rsquo; voyage
      with the screw racing half her time. But, as I was saying, the population
      o&rsquo; Larut was five all told of English&mdash;that is to say, Scotch&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      I&rsquo;m Scotch, ye know,&rsquo; said the Chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Man from Orizava lit another cigarette, and waited patiently. It was
      hopeless to hurry the Chief Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not pretending to account for the population o&rsquo; Larut being laid
      down according to such fabulous dimensions. O&rsquo; the five white men engaged
      upon the extraction o&rsquo; tin ore and mercantile pursuits, there were three
      o&rsquo; the sons o&rsquo; Anak. Wait while I remember. Lammitter was the first by two
      inches&mdash;a giant in the land, an&rsquo; a terreefic man to cross in his
      ways. From heel to head he was six feet nine inches, and proportionately
      built across and through the thickness of his body. Six good feet nine
      inches&mdash;an overbearin&rsquo; man. Next to him, and I have forgotten his
      precise business, was Sandy Vowle. And he was six feet seven, but lean and
      lathy, and it was more in the elasteecity of his neck that the height lay
      than in any honesty o&rsquo; bone and sinew. Five feet and a few odd inches may
      have been his real height. The remainder came out when he held up his
      head, and six feet seven he was upon the door-sills. I took his measure in
      chalk standin&rsquo; on a chair. And next to him, but a proportionately made
      man, ruddy and of a fair countenance, was Jock Coan&mdash;that they called
      the Fir Cone. He was but six feet five, and a child beside Lammitter and
      Vowle. When the three walked out together, they made a scunner run through
      the colony o&rsquo; Larut. The Malays ran round them as though they had been the
      giant trees in the Yosemite Valley&mdash;these three Lang Men o&rsquo; Larut. It
      was perfectly ridiculous&mdash;a lusus naturae&mdash;that one little place
      should have contained maybe the three tallest ordinar&rsquo; men upon the face
      o&rsquo; the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obsairve now the order o&rsquo; things. For it led to the finest big drink in
      Larut, and six sore heads the morn that endured for a week. I am against
      immoderate liquor, but the event to follow was a justification. You must
      understand that many coasting steamers call at Larut wi&rsquo; strangers o&rsquo; the
      mercantile profession. In the spring time, when the young cocoanuts were
      ripening, and the trees o&rsquo; the forests were putting forth their leaves,
      there came an American man to Larut, and he was six foot three, or it may
      have been four, in his stockings. He came on business from Sacramento, but
      he stayed for pleasure wi&rsquo; the Lang Men o&rsquo; Larut. Less than, a half o&rsquo; the
      population were ordinar&rsquo; in their girth and stature, ye will understand&mdash;Howson
      and Nailor, merchants, five feet nine or thereabouts. He had business with
      those two, and he stood above them from the six feet threedom o&rsquo; his
      height till they went to drink. In the course o&rsquo; conversation he said, as
      tall men will, things about his height, and the trouble of it to him. That
      was his pride o&rsquo; the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;As the longest man in the island&mdash;&rdquo; he said, but there they took
      him up and asked if he were sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I say I am the longest man in the island,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and on that I&rsquo;ll
      bet my substance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They laid down the bed-plates of a big drink then and there, and put it
      aside while they called Jock Coan from his house, near by among the
      fireflies&rsquo; winking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s a&rsquo; wi&rsquo; you?&rdquo; said Jock, and came in by the side o&rsquo; the Sacramento
      profligate, two inches, or it may have been one, taller than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re long,&rdquo; said the man, opening his eyes. &ldquo;But I am longer.&rdquo; An&rsquo; 
      they sent a whistle through the night an&rsquo; howkit out Sandy Vowle from his
      bit bungalow, and he came in an&rsquo; stood by the side o&rsquo; Jock, an&rsquo; the pair
      just fillit the room to the ceiling-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Sacramento man was a euchre-player and a most profane sweerer. &ldquo;You
      hold both Bowers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the Joker is with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Fair an&rsquo; softly,&rdquo; says Nailor. &ldquo;Jock, whaur&rsquo;s Lang Lammitter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says that man, putting his leg through the window and coming in
      like an anaconda o&rsquo; the desert furlong by furlong, one foot in Penang and
      one in Batavia, and a hand in North Borneo it may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Are you suited?&rdquo; said Nailor, when the hinder end o&rsquo; Lang Lammitter was
      slidden through the sill an&rsquo; the head of Lammitter was lost in the smoke
      away above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The American man took out his card and put it on the table. &ldquo;Esdras B.
      Longer is my name, America is my nation, &lsquo;Frisco is my resting-place, but
      this here beats Creation,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Boys, giants&mdash;side-show giants&mdash;I
      minded to slide out of my bet if I had been overtopped, on the strength of
      the riddle on this paste-board. I would have done it if you had topped me
      even by three inches, but when it comes to feet&mdash;yards&mdash;miles, I
      am not the man to shirk the biggest drink that ever made the
      travellers&rsquo;-joy palm blush with virginal indignation, or the orang-outang
      and the perambulating dyak howl with envy. Set them up and continue till
      the final conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O mon, I tell you &lsquo;twas an awful sight to see those four giants threshing
      about the house and the island, and tearin&rsquo; down the pillars thereof an&rsquo; 
      throwing palm-trees broadcast, and currling their long legs round the
      hills o&rsquo; Larut. An awfu&rsquo; sight! I was there. I did not mean to tell you,
      but it&rsquo;s out now. I was not overcome, for I e&rsquo;en sat me down under the
      pieces o&rsquo; the table at four the morn an&rsquo; meditated upon the strangeness of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Losh, yon&rsquo;s the breakfast-bell!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      REINGELDER AND THE GERMAN FLAG
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; CO.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans Breitmann paddled across the deck in his pink pyjamas, a cup of tea
      in one hand and a cheroot in the other, when the steamer was sweltering
      down the coast on her way to Singapur. He drank beer all day and all
      night, and played a game called &lsquo;Scairt&rsquo; with three compatriots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haf washed,&rsquo; said he in a voice of thunder, &lsquo;but dere is no use washing
      on these hell-seas. Look at me&mdash;I am still all wet and schweatin&rsquo;. It
      is der tea dot makes me so. Boy, bring me Bilsener on ice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will die if you drink beer before breakfast,&rsquo; said one man. &lsquo;Beer is
      the worst thing in the world for&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ya, I know&mdash;der liver. I haf no liver, und I shall not die. At least
      I will not die obon dese benny sdeamers dot haf no beer fit to trink. If I
      should haf died, I will haf don so a hoondert dimes before now&mdash;in
      Shermany, in New York, in Japon, in Assam, und all over der inside bans of
      South Amerique. Also in Shamaica should I hat died or in Siam, but I am
      here; und der are my orchits dot I have drafelled all the vorld round to
      find.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed towards the wheel, where, in two rough wooden boxes, lay a mass
      of shrivelled vegetation, supposed by all the ship to represent Assam
      orchids of fabulous value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, orchids do not grow in the main streets of towns, and Hans Breitmann
      had gone far to get his. There was nothing that he had not collected that
      year, from king-crabs to white kangaroos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lisden now,&rsquo; said he, after he had been speaking for not much more than
      ten minutes without a pause; &lsquo;Lisden und I will dell you a sdory to show
      how bad und worse it is to go gollectin&rsquo; und belief vot anoder fool haf
      said. Dis was in Uraguay which was in Amerique&mdash;North or Sout&rsquo; you
      would not know&mdash;und I was hoontin&rsquo; orchits und aferydings else dot I
      could back in my kanasters&mdash;dot is drafelling sbecimen-gaces. Dere

      vas hoontin&rsquo; also but only coral-snakes&mdash;joost Uraguay coral-snakes&mdash;aferykind

      white like coral dot has been gestrung in bands upon der neck of a girl.
      Dere is one snake howefer dot we who gollect know ash der Sherman Flag,
      pecause id is red und plack und white, joost like a sausage mit druffles.
      Reingelder he was naturalist&mdash;goot man&mdash;goot trinker&mdash;better
      as me! &ldquo;By Gott,&rdquo; said Reingelder, &ldquo;I will get a Sherman Flag snake or I
      will die.&rdquo; Und we toorned all Uraguay upside-behint all pecause of dot
      Sherman Flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Von day when we was in none knows where&mdash;shwingin&rsquo; in our hummocks
      among der woods, oop comes a natif woman mit a Sherman Flag in a
      bickle-bottle&mdash;my bickle-bottle&mdash;und we both fell from our
      hummocks flat ubon our pot&mdash;what you call stomach&mdash;mit shoy at
      dis thing. Now I was gollectin&rsquo; orchits also, und I knowed dot der idee of
      life to Reingelder vas dis Sherman Flag. Derefore I bicked myselfs oop und
      I said, &ldquo;Reingelder, dot is YOUR find.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Heart&rsquo;s true friend, dou
      art a goot man,&rdquo; said Reingelder, und mit dot he obens der bickle-bottle,
      und der natif woman she shqueals: &ldquo;Herr Gott! It will bite.&rdquo; I said&mdash;pecause
      in Uraguay a man must be careful of der insects&mdash;&ldquo;Reingelder,
      shpifligate her in der alcohol und den she will be all right.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nein,&rdquo;
       said Reingelder, &ldquo;I will der shnake alife examine. Dere is no fear. Der
      coral-shnakes are mitout shting-apparatus brofided.&rdquo; Boot I looked at her
      het, und she vas der het of a boison-shnake&mdash;der true viper cranium,
      narrow und contract. &ldquo;It is not goot,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she may bite und den&mdash;we
      are tree hoondert mile from aferywheres. Broduce der alcohol und bickle
      him alife.&rdquo; Reingelder he had him in his hand&mdash;grawlin&rsquo; und grawlin&rsquo; 
      as slow as a woorm und dwice as guiet. &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; says Reingelder. &ldquo;Yates
      haf said dot not von of der coral-shnakes haf der sack of boison.&rdquo; Yates
      vas der crate authorite ubon der reptilia of Sout&rsquo; Amerique. He haf
      written a book. You do not know, of course, but he vas a crate authorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gum my eye upon der Sherman Flag, grawlin&rsquo; und grawlin&rsquo; in Reingelder&rsquo;s
      fist, und der het vas not der het of innocence. &ldquo;Mein Gott,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It

     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Den you may haf der shnake,&rdquo; says Reingelder, pattin&rsquo; it ubon her het.
      &ldquo;See now, I will show you vat Yates haf written!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uud mit dot he went indo his dent, unt brung out his big book of Yates;

    <h2>
      THE WANDERING JEW
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by Macmillan &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you go once round the world in an easterly direction, you gain one
      day,&rsquo; said the men of science to John Hay. In after years John Hay went
      east, west, north, and south, transacted business, made love, and begat a
      family, as have done many men, and the scientific information above
      recorded lay neglected in the deeps of his mind with a thousand other
      matters of equal importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a rich relative died, he found himself wealthy beyond any reasonable
      expectation that he had entertained in his previous career, which had been
      a chequered and evil one. Indeed, long before the legacy came to him,
      there existed in the brain of John Hay a little cloud-a momentary
      obscuration of thought that came and went almost before he could realize
      that there was any solution of continuity. So do the bats flit round the
      eaves of a house to show that the darkness is falling. He entered upon
      great possessions, in money, land, and houses; but behind his delight
      stood a ghost that cried out that his enjoyment of these things should not
      be of long duration. It was the ghost of the rich relative, who had been
      permitted to return to earth to torture his nephew into the grave.
      Wherefore, under the spur of this constant reminder, John Hay, always
      preserving the air of heavy business-like stolidity that hid the shadow on
      his mind, turned investments, houses, and lands into sovereigns&mdash;-rich,
      round, red, English sovereigns, each one worth twenty shillings. Lands may
      become valueless, and houses fly heavenward on the wings of red flame, but
      till the Day of Judgment a sovereign will always be a sovereign&mdash;that
      is to say, a king of pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed of his sovereigns, John Hay would fain have spent them one by
      one on such coarse amusements as his soul loved; but he was haunted by the
      instant fear of Death; for the ghost of his relative stood in the hall of
      his house close to the hat-rack, shouting up the stairway that life was
      short, that there was no hope of increase of days, and that the
      undertakers were already roughing out his nephew&rsquo;s coffin. John Hay was
      generally alone in the house, and even when he had company, his friends
      could not hear the clamorous uncle. The shadow inside his brain grew
      larger and blacker. His fear of death was driving John Hay mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, from the deeps of his mind, where he had stowed away all his
      discarded information, rose to light the scientific fact of the Easterly
      journey. On the next occasion that his uncle shouted up the stairway
      urging him to make haste and live, a shriller voice cried, &lsquo;Who goes round
      the world once easterly, gains one day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His growing diffidence and distrust of mankind made John Hay unwilling to
      give this precious message of hope to his friends. They might take it up
      and analyse it. He was sure it was true, but it would pain him acutely
      were rough hands to examine it too closely. To him alone of all the
      toiling generations of mankind had the secret of immortality been
      vouchsafed. It would be impious&mdash;against all the designs of the
      Creator&mdash;to set mankind hurrying eastward. Besides, this would crowd
      the steamers inconveniently, and John Hay wished of all things to be
      alone. If he could get round the world in two months&mdash;some one of
      whom he had read, he could not remember the name, had covered the passage
      in eighty days&mdash;he would gain a clear day; and by steadily continuing
      to do it for thirty years, would gain one hundred and eighty days, or
      nearly the half of a year. It would not be much, but in course of time, as
      civilisation advanced, and the Euphrates Valley Railway was opened, he
      could improve the pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with many sovereigns, John Hay, in the thirty-fifth year of his age,
      set forth on his travels, two voices bearing him company from Dover as he
      sailed to Calais. Fortune favoured him. The Euphrates Valley Railway was
      newly opened, and he was the first man who took ticket direct from Calais
      to Calcutta&mdash;thirteen days in the train. Thirteen days in the train
      are not good for the nerves; but he covered the world and returned to
      Calais from America in twelve days over the two months, and started afresh
      with four and twenty hours of precious time to his credit. Three years
      passed, and John Hay religiously went round this earth seeking for more
      time wherein to enjoy the remainder of his sovereigns. He became known on
      many lines as the man who wanted to go on; when people asked him what he
      was and what he did, he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the person who intends to live, and I am trying to do it now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His days were divided between watching the white wake spinning behind the
      stern of the swiftest steamers, or the brown earth flashing past the
      windows of the fastest trains; and he noted in a pocket-book every minute
      that he had railed or screwed out of remorseless eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is better than praying for long life,&rsquo; quoth John Hay as he turned
      his face eastward for his twentieth trip. The years had done more for him
      than he dared to hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the extension of the Brahmaputra Valley line to meet the
      newly-developed China Midland, the Calais railway ticket held good via
      Karachi and Calcutta to Hongkong. The round trip could be managed in a
      fraction over forty-seven days, and, filled with fatal exultation, John
      Hay told the secret of his longevity to his only friend, the house-keeper
      of his rooms in London. He spoke and passed; but the woman was one of
      resource, and immediately took counsel with the lawyers who had first
      informed John Hay of his golden legacy. Very many sovereigns still
      remained, and another Hay longed to spend them on things more sensible
      than railway tickets and steamer accommodation.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The chase was long, for when a man is journeying literally for the dear
life, he does not tarry upon the road. Round the world Hay swept anew,
and overtook the wearied Doctor, who had been sent out to look for him,
in Madras. It was there that he found the reward of his toil and the
assurance of a blessed immortality. In half an hour the Doctor, watching
always the parched lips, the shaking hands, and the eye that turned
eternally to the east, won John Hay to rest in a little house close to
the Madras surf. All that Hay need do was to hang by ropes from the roof
of the room and let the round earth swing free beneath him. This was
better than steamer or train, for he gained a day in a day, and was
thus the equal of the undying sun. The other Hay would pay his expenses
throughout eternity.

 It is true that we cannot yet take tickets from Calais to Hongkong,
though that will come about in fifteen years; but men say that if you
wander along the southern coast of India you shall find in a neatly
whitewashed little bungalow, sitting in a chair swung from the
roof, over a sheet of thin steel which he knows so well destroys the
attraction of the earth, an old and worn man who for ever faces the
rising sun, a stop-watch in his hand, racing against eternity. He cannot
drink, he does not smoke, and his living expenses amount to perhaps
twenty-five rupees a month, but he is John Hay, the Immortal. Without,
he hears the thunder of the wheeling world with which he is careful to
explain he has no connection whatever; but if you say that it is only
the noise of the surf, he will cry bitterly, for the shadow on his brain
is passing away as the brain ceases to work, and he doubts sometimes
whether the doctor spoke the truth.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does not the sun always remain over my head?&rsquo; asks John Hay.

    <h2>
      THROUGH THE FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Policeman rode through the Himalayan forest, under the moss-draped
      oaks, and his orderly trotted after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly business, Bhere Singh,&rsquo; said the Policeman. &lsquo;Where are
      they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a very ugly business,&rsquo; said Bhere Singh; &lsquo;and as for THEM, they
      are, doubtless, now frying in a hotter fire than was ever made of
      spruce-branches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us hope not,&rsquo; said the Policeman, &lsquo;for, allowing for the difference
      between race and race, it&rsquo;s the story of Francesca da Rimini, Bhere
      Singh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bhere Singh knew nothing about Francesca da Rimini, so he held his peace
      until they came to the charcoal-burners&rsquo; clearing where the dying flames
      said &lsquo;whit, whit, whit&rsquo; as they fluttered and whispered over the white
      ashes. It must have been a great fire when at full height. Men had seen it
      at Donga Pa across the valley winking and blazing through the night, and
      said that the charcoal-burners of Kodru were getting drunk. But it was
      only Suket Singh, Sepoy of the load Punjab Native Infantry, and Athira, a
      woman, burning&mdash;burning&mdash;burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how things befell; and the Policeman&rsquo;s Diary will bear me out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Athira was the wife of Madu, who was a charcoal-burner, one-eyed and of a
      malignant disposition. A week after their marriage, he beat Athira with a
      heavy stick. A month later, Suket Singh, Sepoy, came that way to the cool
      hills on leave from his regiment, and electrified the villagers of Kodru
      with tales of service and glory under the Government, and the honour in
      which he, Suket Singh, was held by the Colonel Sahib Bahadur. And
      Desdemona listened to Othello as Desdemonas have done all the world over,
      and, as she listened, she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a wife of my own,&rsquo; said Suket Singh, &lsquo;though that is no matter when
      you come to think of it. I am also due to return to my regiment after a
      time, and I cannot be a deserter&mdash;I who intend to be Havildar.&rsquo; There
      is no Himalayan version of &lsquo;I could not love thee, dear, as much, Loved I
      not Honour more;&rsquo; but Suket Singh came near to making one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Athira, &lsquo;stay with me, and, if Madu tries to beat me,
      you beat him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said Suket Singh; and he beat Madu severely, to the delight
      of all the charcoal-burners of Kodru.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is enough,&rsquo; said Suket Singh, as he rolled Madu down the hillside.
      &lsquo;Now we shall have peace.&rsquo; But Madu crawled up the grass slope again, and
      hovered round his hut with angry eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll kill me dead,&rsquo; said Athira to Suket Singh. &lsquo;You must take me away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be a trouble in the Lines. My wife will pull out my beard; but
      never mind,&rsquo; said Suket Singh, &lsquo;I will take you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was loud trouble in the Lines, and Suket Singh&rsquo;s beard was pulled,
      and Suket Singh&rsquo;s wife went to live with her mother and took away the
      children. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Athira; and Suket Singh said, &lsquo;Yes,
      that&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was only Madu left in the hut that looks across the valley to
      Donga Pa; and, since the beginning of time, no one has had any sympathy
      for husbands so unfortunate as Madu.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Juseen Daze, the wizard-man who keeps the Talking Monkey&rsquo;s
      Head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get me back my wife,&rsquo; said Madu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Juseen Daze, &lsquo;until you have made the Sutlej in the valley
      run up the Donga Pa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No riddles,&rsquo; said Madu, and he shook his hatchet above Juseen Daze&rsquo;s
      white head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give all your money to the headmen of the village,&rsquo; said Juseen Daze;
      &lsquo;and they will hold a communal Council, and the Council will send a
      message that your wife must come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Madu gave up all his worldly wealth, amounting to twenty-seven rupees,
      eight annas, three pice, and a silver chain, to the Council of Kodru. And
      it fell as Juseen Daze foretold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sent Athira&rsquo;s brother down into Suket Singh&rsquo;s regiment to call Athira
      home. Suket Singh kicked him once round the Lines, and then handed him
      over to the Havildar, who beat him with a belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come back,&rsquo; yelled Athira&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; said Athira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Madu,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then Juseen Daze will send a curse, and you will wither away like a
      barked tree in the springtime,&rsquo; said Athira&rsquo;s brother. Athira slept over
      these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she had rheumatism. &lsquo;I am beginning to wither away like a
      barked tree in the springtime,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;That is the curse of Juseen
      Daze.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And she really began to wither away because her heart was dried up with
      fear, and those who believe in curses die from curses. Suket Singh, too,
      was afraid because he loved Athira better than his very life. Two months
      passed, and Athira&rsquo;s brother stood outside the regimental Lines again and
      yelped, &lsquo;Aha! You are withering away. Come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come back,&rsquo; said Athira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say rather that WE will come back,&rsquo; said Suket Singh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ai; but when?&rsquo; said Athira&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon a day very early in the morning,&rsquo; said Suket Singh; and he tramped
      off to apply to the Colonel Sahib Bahadur for one week&rsquo;s leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am withering away like a barked tree in the spring,&rsquo; moaned Athira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be better soon,&rsquo; said Suket Singh; and he told her what was in
      his heart, and the two laughed together softly, for they loved each other.
      But Athira grew better from that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went away together, travelling third-class by train as the
      regulations provided, and then in a cart to the low hills, and on foot to
      the high ones. Athira sniffed the scent of the pines of her own hills, the
      wet Himalayan hills. &lsquo;It is good to be alive,&rsquo; said Athira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; said Suket Singh. &lsquo;Where is the Kodru road and where is the Forest
      Ranger&rsquo;s house?&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It cost forty rupees twelve years ago,&rsquo; said the Forest Ranger, handing
      the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here are twenty,&rsquo; said Suket Singh, &lsquo;and you must give me the best
      bullets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very good to be alive,&rsquo; said Athira wistfully, sniffing the scent
      of the pine-mould; and they waited till the night had fallen upon Kodru
      and the Donga Pa. Madu had stacked the dry wood for the next day&rsquo;s
      charcoal-burning on the spur above his house. &lsquo;It is courteous in Madu to
      save us this trouble,&rsquo; said Suket Singh as he stumbled on the pile, which
      was twelve foot square and four high. &lsquo;We must wait till the moon rises.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the moon rose, Athira knelt upon the pile. &lsquo;If it were only a
      Government Snider,&rsquo; said Suket Singh ruefully, squinting down the
      wire-bound barrel of the Forest Ranger&rsquo;s gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quick,&rsquo; said Athira; and Suket Singh was quick; but Athira was quick
      no longer. Then he lit the pile at the four corners and climbed on to it,
      re-loading the gun.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The little flames began to peer up between the big logs atop of the
brushwood. &lsquo;The Government should teach us to pull the triggers with
our toes,&rsquo; said Suket Singh grimly to the moon. That was the last public
observation of Sepoy Suket Singh.

 Upon a day, early in the morning, Madu came to the pyre and shrieked
very grievously, and ran away to catch the Policeman who was on tour in
the district.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The base-born has ruined four rupees&rsquo; worth of charcoal wood,&rsquo; Madu
      gasped. &lsquo;He has also killed my wife, and he has left a letter which I
      cannot read, tied to a pine bough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stiff, formal hand taught in the regimental school, Sepoy Suket
      Singh had written&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us be burned together, if anything remain over, for we have made the
      necessary prayers. We have also cursed Madu, and Malak the brother of
      Athira&mdash;both evil men. Send my service to the Colonel Sahib Bahadur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Policeman looked long and curiously at the marriage bed of red and
      white ashes on which lay, dull black, the barrel of the Ranger&rsquo;s gun. He
      drove his spurred heel absently into a half-charred log, and the
      chattering sparks flew upwards. &lsquo;Most extraordinary people,&rsquo; said the
      Policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WHE-W, WHEW, OUIOU,&rsquo; said the little flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Policeman entered the dry bones of the case, for the Punjab Government
      does not approve of romancing, in his Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But who will pay me those four rupees?&rsquo; said Madu.

    <h2>
      THE FINANCES OF THE GODS
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening meal was ended in Dhunni Bhagat&rsquo;s Chubara and the old priests
      were smoking or counting their beads. A little naked child pattered in,
      with its mouth wide open, a handful of marigold flowers in one hand, and a
      lump of conserved tobacco in the other. It tried to kneel and make
      obeisance to Gobind, but it was so fat that it fell forward on its shaven
      head, and rolled on its side, kicking and gasping, while the marigolds
      tumbled one way and the tobacco the other. Gobind laughed, set it up
      again, and blessed the marigold flowers as he received the tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From my father,&rsquo; said the child. &lsquo;He has the fever, and cannot come. Wilt
      thou pray for him, father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely, littlest; but the smoke is on the ground, and the night-chill is
      in the airs, and it is not good to go abroad naked in the autumn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no clothes,&rsquo; said the child, &lsquo;and all to-day I have been carrying
      cow-dung cakes to the bazar. It was very hot, and I am very tired.&rsquo; It
      shivered a little, for the twilight was cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gobind lifted an arm under his vast tattered quilt of many colours, and
      made an inviting little nest by his side. The child crept in, and Gobind
      filled his brass-studded leather waterpipe with the new tobacco. When I
      came to the Chubara the shaven head with the tuft atop, and the beady
      black eyes looked out of the folds of the quilt as a squirrel looks out
      from his nest, and Gobind was smiling while the child played with his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have said something friendly, but remembered in time that if the
      child fell ill afterwards I should be credited with the Evil Eye, and that
      is a horrible possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit thou still, Thumbling,&rsquo; I said as it made to get up and run away.
      &lsquo;Where is thy slate, and why has the teacher let such an evil character
      loose on the streets when there are no police to protect us weaklings? In
      which ward dost thou try to break thy neck with flying kites from the
      house-tops?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, Sahib, nay,&rsquo; said the child, burrowing its face into Gobind&rsquo;s beard,
      and twisting uneasily. &lsquo;There was a holiday to-day among the schools, and
      I do not always fly kites. I play ker-li-kit like the rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cricket is the national game among the schoolboys of the Punjab, from the
      naked hedge-school children, who use an old kerosene-tin for wicket, to
      the B.A.&lsquo;s of the University, who compete for the Championship belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou play kerlikit! Thou art half the height of the bat!&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child nodded resolutely. &lsquo;Yea, I DO play. PERLAYBALL OW-AT! RAN, RAN,
      RAN! I know it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But thou must not forget with all this to pray to the Gods according to
      custom,&rsquo; said Gobind, who did not altogether approve of cricket and
      western innovations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not forget,&rsquo; said the child in a hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Also to give reverence to thy teacher, and&rsquo;&mdash;Gobind&rsquo;s voice softened&mdash;&rsquo; 
      to abstain from pulling holy men by the beard, little badling. Eh, eh,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s face was altogether hidden in the great white beard, and it
      began to whimper till Gobind soothed it as children are soothed all the
      world over, with the promise of a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not think to frighten thee, senseless little one. Look up! Am I
      angry? Are, are, are! Shall I weep too, and of our tears make a great pond
      and drown us both, and then thy father will never get well, lacking thee
      to pull his beard? Peace, peace, and I will tell thee of the Gods. Thou
      hast heard many tales?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very many, father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, this is a new one which thou hast not heard. Long and long ago when
      the Gods walked with men as they do to-day, but that we have not faith to
      see, Shiv, the greatest of Gods, and Parbati his wife, were walking in the
      garden of a temple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which temple? That in the Nandgaon ward?&rsquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, very far away. Maybe at Trimbak or Hurdwar, whither thou must make
      pilgrimage when thou art a man. Now, there was sitting in the garden under
      the jujube trees, a mendicant that had worshipped Shiv for forty years,
      and he lived on the offerings of the pious, and meditated holiness night
      and day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh father, was it thou?&rsquo; said the child, looking up with large eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I have said it was long ago, and, moreover, this mendicant was
      married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did they put him on a horse with flowers on his head, and forbid him to
      go to sleep all night long? Thus they did to me when they made my
      wedding,&rsquo; said the child, who had been married a few months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what didst thou do?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wept, and they called me evil names, and then I smote HER, and we wept
      together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus did not the mendicant,&rsquo; said Gobind; &lsquo;for he was a holy man, and
      very poor. Parbati perceived him sitting naked by the temple steps where
      all went up and down, and she said to Shiv, &ldquo;What shall men think of the
      Gods when the Gods thus scorn their worshippers? For forty years yonder
      man has prayed to us, and yet there be only a few grains of rice and some
      broken cowries before him after all. Men&rsquo;s hearts will be hardened by this
      thing.&rdquo; And Shiv said, &ldquo;It shall be looked to,&rdquo; and so he called to the
      temple which was the temple of his son, Ganesh of the elephant head,
      saying, &ldquo;Son, there is a mendicant without who is very poor. What wilt
      thou do for him?&rdquo; Then that great elephant-headed One awoke in the dark
      and answered, &ldquo;In three days, if it be thy will, he shall have one lakh of
      rupees.&rdquo; Then Shiv and Parbati went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there was a money-lender in the garden hidden among the marigolds&rsquo;&mdash;the
      child looked at the ball of crumpled blossoms in its hands&mdash;&lsquo;ay,
      among the yellow marigolds, and he heard the Gods talking. He was a
      covetous man, and of a black heart, and he desired that lakh of rupees for
      himself. So he went to the mendicant and said, &ldquo;O brother, how much do the
      pious give thee daily?&rdquo; The mendicant said, &ldquo;I cannot tell. Sometimes a
      little rice, sometimes a little pulse, and a few cowries and, it has been,
      pickled mangoes, and dried fish.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is good,&rsquo; said the child, smacking its lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then said the money-lender, &ldquo;Because I have long watched thee, and
      learned to love thee and thy patience, I will give thee now five rupees
      for all thy earnings of the three days to come. There is only a bond to
      sign on the matter.&rdquo; But the mendicant said, &ldquo;Thou art mad. In two months
      I do not receive the worth of five rupees,&rdquo; and he told the thing to his
      wife that evening. She, being a woman, said, &ldquo;When did money-lender ever
      make a bad bargain? The wolf runs through the corn for the sake of the fat
      deer. Our fate is in the hands of the Gods. Pledge it not even for three
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So the mendicant returned to the money-lender, and would not sell. Then
      that wicked man sat all day before him offering more and more for those
      three days&rsquo; earnings. First, ten, fifty, and a hundred rupees; and then,
      for he did not know when the Gods would pour down their gifts, rupees by
      the thousand, till he had offered half a lakh of rupees. Upon this sum the
      mendicant&rsquo;s wife shifted her counsel, and the mendicant signed the bond,
      and the money was paid in silver; great white bullocks bringing it by the
      cartload. But saving only all that money, the mendicant received nothing
      from the Gods at all, and the heart of the money-lender was uneasy on
      account of expectation. Therefore at noon of the third day the
      money-lender went into the temple to spy upon the councils of the Gods,
      and to learn in what manner that gift might arrive. Even as he was making
      his prayers, a crack between the stones of the floor gaped, and, closing,
      caught him by the heel. Then he heard the Gods walking in the temple in
      the darkness of the columns, and Shiv called to his son Ganesh, saying,
      &ldquo;Son, what hast thou done in regard to the lakh of rupees for the
      mendicant?&rdquo; And Ganesh woke, for the money-lender heard the dry rustle of
      his trunk uncoiling, and he answered, &ldquo;Father, one half of the money has
      been paid, and the debtor for the other half I hold here fast by the
      heel.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child bubbled with laughter. &lsquo;And the moneylender paid the mendicant?&rsquo; 
      it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely, for he whom the Gods hold by the heel must pay to the uttermost.
      The money was paid at evening, all silver, in great carts, and thus Ganesh
      did his work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nathu! Ohe Nathu!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman was calling in the dusk by the door of the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child began to wriggle. &lsquo;That is my mother,&rsquo; it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go then, littlest,&rsquo; answered Gobind; &lsquo;but stay a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ripped a generous yard from his patchwork-quilt, put it over the
      child&rsquo;s shoulders, and the child ran away.

    <h2>
      THE AMIR&rsquo;S HOMILY
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MacMillan &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      His Royal Highness Abdur Rahman, Amir of Afghanistan, G.C.S.I., and
      trusted ally of Her Imperial Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of
      India, is a gentleman for whom all right-thinking people should have a
      profound regard. Like most other rulers, he governs not as he would but as
      he can, and the mantle of his authority covers the most turbulent race
      under the stars. To the Afghan neither life, property, law, nor kingship
      are sacred when his own lusts prompt him to rebel. He is a thief by
      instinct, a murderer by heredity and training, and frankly and bestially
      immoral by all three. None the less he has his own crooked notions of
      honour, and his character is fascinating to study. On occasion he will
      fight without reason given till he is hacked in pieces; on other occasions
      he will refuse to show fight till he is driven into a corner. Herein he is
      as unaccountable as the gray wolf, who is his blood-brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these men His Highness rules by the only weapon that they understand&mdash;the
      fear of death, which among some Orientals is the beginning of wisdom. Some
      say that the Amir&rsquo;s authority reaches no farther than a rifle bullet can
      range; but as none are quite certain when their king may be in their
      midst, and as he alone holds every one of the threads of Government, his
      respect is increased among men. Gholam Hyder, the Commander-in-chief of
      the Afghan army, is feared reasonably, for he can impale; all Kabul city
      fears the Governor of Kabul, who has power of life and death through all
      the wards; but the Amir of Afghanistan, though outlying tribes pretend
      otherwise when his back is turned, is dreaded beyond chief and governor
      together. His word is red law; by the gust of his passion falls the leaf
      of man&rsquo;s life, and his favour is terrible. He has suffered many things,
      and been a hunted fugitive before he came to the throne, and he
      understands all the classes of his people. By the custom of the East any
      man or woman having a complaint to make, or an enemy against whom to be
      avenged, has the right of speaking face to face with the king at the daily
      public audience. This is personal government, as it was in the days of
      Harun al Raschid of blessed memory, whose times exist still and will exist
      long after the English have passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privilege of open speech is of course exercised at certain personal
      risk. The king may be pleased, and raise the speaker to honour for that
      very bluntness of speech which three minutes later brings a too imitative
      petitioner to the edge of the ever ready blade. And the people love to
      have it so, for it is their right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened upon a day in Kabul that the Amir chose to do his day&rsquo;s work
      in the Baber Gardens, which lie a short distance from the city of Kabul. A
      light table stood before him, and round the table in the open air were
      grouped generals and finance ministers according to their degree. The
      Court and the long tail of feudal chiefs&mdash;men of blood, fed and cowed
      by blood&mdash;stood in an irregular semicircle round the table, and the
      wind from the Kabul orchards blew among them. All day long sweating
      couriers dashed in with letters from the outlying districts with rumours
      of rebellion, intrigue, famine, failure of payments, or announcements of
      treasure on the road; and all day long the Amir would read the dockets,
      and pass such of these as were less private to the officials whom they
      directly concerned, or call up a waiting chief for a word of explanation.
      It is well to speak clearly to the ruler of Afghanistan. Then the grim
      head, under the black astrachan cap with the diamond star in front, would
      nod gravely, and that chief would return to his fellows. Once that
      afternoon a woman clamoured for divorce against her husband, who was bald,
      and the Amir, hearing both sides of the case, bade her pour curds over the
      bare scalp, and lick them off, that the hair might grown again, and she be
      contented. Here the Court laughed, and the woman withdrew, cursing her
      king under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when twilight was falling, and the order of the Court was a little
      relaxed, there came before the king, in custody, a trembling haggard
      wretch, sore with much buffeting, but of stout enough build, who had
      stolen three rupees&mdash;of such small matters does His Highness take
      cognisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you steal?&rsquo; said he; and when the king asks questions they do
      themselves service who answer directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was poor, and no one gave. Hungry, and there was no food.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you not work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could find no work, Protector of the Poor, and I was starving.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You lie. You stole for drink, for lust, for idleness, for anything but
      hunger, since any man who will may find work and daily bread.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoner dropped his eyes. He had attended the Court before, and he
      knew the ring of the death-tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any man may get work. Who knows this so well as I do? for I too have been
      hungered&mdash;not like you, bastard scum, but as any honest man may be,
      by the turn of Fate and the will of God.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing warm, the Amir turned to his nobles all arow and thrust the hilt
      of his sabre aside with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have heard this Son of Lies? Hear me tell a true tale. I also was
      once starved, and tightened my belt on the sharp belly-pinch. Nor was I
      alone, for with me was another, who did not fail me in my evil days, when
      I was hunted, before ever I came to this throne. And wandering like a
      houseless dog by Kandahar, my money melted, melted, melted till&mdash;&rsquo; He
      flung out a bare palm before the audience. &lsquo;And day upon day, faint and
      sick, I went back to that one who waited, and God knows how we lived, till
      on a day I took our best lihaf&mdash;silk it was, fine work of Iran, such
      as no needle now works, warm, and a coverlet for two, and all that we had.
      I brought it to a money-lender in a bylane, and I asked for three rupees
      upon it. He said to me, who am now the King, &ldquo;You are a thief. This is
      worth three hundred.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am no thief,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but a prince of good
      blood, and I am hungry.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Prince of wandering beggars,&rdquo; said that
      money-lender, &ldquo;I have no money with me, but go to my house with my clerk
      and he will give you two rupees eight annas, for that is all I will lend.&rdquo;
       So I went with the clerk to the house, and we talked on the way, and he
      gave me the money. We lived on it till it was spent, and we fared hard.
      And then that clerk said, being a young man of a good heart, &ldquo;Surely the
      money-lender will lend yet more on that lihaf,&rdquo; and he offered me two
      rupees. These I refused, saying, &ldquo;Nay; but get me some work.&rdquo; And he got
      me work, and I, even I, Abdur Rahman, Amir of Afghanistan, wrought day by
      day as a coolie, bearing burdens, and labouring of my hands, receiving
      four annas wage a day for my sweat and backache. But he, this bastard son
      of naught, must steal! For a year and four months I worked, and none dare
      say that I lie, for I have a witness, even that clerk who is now my
      friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there rose in his place among the Sirdars and the nobles one clad in
      silk, who folded his hands and said, &lsquo;This is the truth of God, for I,
      who, by the favour of God and the Amir, am such as you know, was once
      clerk to that money-lender.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and the Amir cried hoarsely to the prisoner, throwing
      scorn upon him, till he ended with the dread &lsquo;Dar arid,&rsquo; which clinches
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they led the thief away, and the whole of him was seen no more
      together; and the Court rustled out of its silence, whispering, &lsquo;Before
      God and the Prophet, but this is a man!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      JEWS IN SHUSHAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1981, by Macmillan &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      My newly purchased house furniture was, at the least, insecure; the legs
      parted from the chairs, and the tops from the tables, on the slightest
      provocation. But such as it was, it was to be paid for, and Ephraim, agent
      and collector for the local auctioneer, waited in the verandah with the
      receipt. He was announced by the Mahomedan servant as &lsquo;Ephraim, Yahudi&rsquo;&mdash;Ephraim
      the Jew. He who believes in the Brotherhood of Man should hear my Elahi
      Bukhsh grinding the second word through his white teeth with all the scorn
      he dare show before his master. Ephraim was, personally, meek in manner&mdash;so
      meek indeed that one could not understand how he had fallen into the
      profession of bill-collecting. He resembled an over-fed sheep, and his
      voice suited his figure. There was a fixed, unvarying mask of childish
      wonder upon his face. If you paid him, he was as one marvelling at your
      wealth; if you sent him away, he seemed puzzled at your hard-heartedness.
      Never was Jew more unlike his dread breed. Ephraim wore list slippers and
      coats of duster-cloth, so preposterously patterned that the most brazen of
      British subalterns would have shied from them in fear. Very slow and
      deliberate was his speech, and carefully guarded to give offence to no
      one. After many weeks, Ephraim was induced to speak to me of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There be eight of us in Shushan, and we are waiting till there are ten.
      Then we shall apply for a synagogue, and get leave from Calcutta. To-day
      we have no synagogue; and I, only I, am Priest and Butcher to our people.
      I am of the tribe of Judah&mdash;I think, but I am not sure. My father was
      of the tribe of Judah, and we wish much to get our synagogue. I shall be a
      priest of that synagogue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shushan is a big city in the North of India, counting its dwellers by the
      ten thousand; and these eight of the Chosen People were shut up in its
      midst, waiting till time or chance sent them their full congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miriam the wife of Ephraim, two little children, an orphan boy of their
      people, Epraim&rsquo;s uncle Jackrael Israel, a white-haired old man, his wife
      Hester, a Jew from Cutch, one Hyem Benjamin, and Ephraim, Priest and
      Butcher, made up the list of the Jews in Shushan. They lived in one house,
      on the outskirts of the great city, amid heaps of saltpetre, rotten
      bricks, herds of kine, and a fixed pillar of dust caused by the incessant
      passing of the beasts to the river to drink. In the evening the children
      of the City came to the waste place to fly their kites, and Ephraim&rsquo;s sons
      held aloof, watching the sport from the roof, but never descending to take
      part in them. At the back of the house stood a small brick enclosure, in
      which Ephraim prepared the daily meat for his people after the custom of
      the Jews. Once the rude door of the square was suddenly smashed open by a
      struggle from inside, and showed the meek bill-collector at his work,
      nostrils dilated, lips drawn back over his teeth, and his hands upon a
      half-maddened sheep. He was attired in strange raiment, having no relation
      whatever to duster coats or list slippers, and a knife was in his mouth.
      As he struggled with the animal between the walls, the breath came from
      him in thick sobs, and the nature of the man seemed changed. When the
      ordained slaughter was ended, he saw that the door was open and shut it
      hastily, his hand leaving a red mark on the timber, while his children
      from the neighbouring house-top looked down awe-stricken and open-eyed. A
      glimpse of Ephraim busied in one of his religious capacities was no thing
      to be desired twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer came upon Shushan, turning the trodden waste-ground to iron, and
      bringing sickness to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will not touch us,&rsquo; said Ephraim confidently. &lsquo;Before the winter we
      shall have our synagogue. My brother and his wife and children are coming
      up from Calcutta, and THEN I shall be the priest of the synagogue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackrael Israel, the old man, would crawl out in the stifling evenings to
      sit on the rubbish-heap and watch the corpses being borne down to the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will not come near us,&rsquo; said Jackrael Israel feebly, &lsquo;for we are the
      People of God, and my nephew will be priest of our synagogue. Let them
      die.&rsquo; He crept back to his house again and barred the door to shut himself
      off from the world of the Gentile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miriam, the wife of Ephraim, looked out of the window at the dead as
      the biers passed and said that she was afraid. Ephraim comforted her with
      hopes of the synagogue to be, and collected bills as was his custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one night, the two children died and were buried early in the morning
      by Ephraim. The deaths never appeared in the City returns. &lsquo;The sorrow is
      my sorrow,&rsquo; said Ephraim; and this to him seemed a sufficient reason for
      setting at naught the sanitary regulations of a large, flourishing, and
      remarkably well-governed Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orphan boy, dependent on the charity of Ephraim and his wife, could
      have felt no gratitude, and must have been a ruffian. He begged for
      whatever money his protectors would give him, and with that fled
      down-country for his life. A week after the death of her children Miriam
      left her bed at night and wandered over the country to find them. She
      heard them crying behind every bush, or drowning in every pool of water in
      the fields, and she begged the cartmen on the Grand Trunk Road not to
      steal her little ones from her. In the morning the sun rose and beat upon
      her bare head, and she turned into the cool wet crops to lie down and
      never came back; though Hyem Benjamin and Ephraim sought her for two
      nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of patient wonder on Ephraim&rsquo;s face deepened, but he presently
      found an explanation. &lsquo;There are so few of us here, and these people are
      so many,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that, it may be, our God has forgotten us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house on the outskirts of the city old Jackrael Israel and Hester
      grumbled that there was no one to wait on them, and that Miriam had been
      untrue to her race. Ephraim went out and collected bills, and in the
      evenings smoked with Hyem Benjamin till, one dawning, Hyem Benjamin died,
      having first paid all his debts to Ephraim. Jackrael Israel and Hester sat
      alone in the empty house all day, and, when Ephraim returned, wept the
      easy tears of age till they cried themselves asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later Ephraim, staggering under a huge bundle of clothes and
      cooking-pots, led the old man and woman to the railway station, where the
      bustle and confusion made them whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are going back to Calcutta,&rsquo; said Ephraim, to whose sleeve Hester was
      clinging. &lsquo;There are more of us there, and here my house is empty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped Hester into the carriage and, turning back, said to me, &lsquo;I
      should have been priest of the synagogue if there had been ten of us.
      Surely we must have been forgotten by our God.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The remnant of the broken colony passed out of the station on their
      journey south; while a subaltern, turning over the books on the bookstall,
      was whistling to himself &lsquo;The Ten Little Nigger Boys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tune sounded as solemn as the Dead March.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the dirge of the Jews in Shushan.

    <h2>
      THE LIMITATIONS OF PAMBE SERANG
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      If you consider the circumstances of the case, it was the only thing that
      he could do. But Pambe Serang has been hanged by the neck till he is dead,
      and Nurkeed is dead also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years ago, when the Elsass-Lothringen steamer Saarbruck was coaling
      at Aden and the weather was very hot indeed, Nurkeed, the big fat Zanzibar
      stoker who fed the second right furnace thirty feet down in the hold, got
      leave to go ashore. He departed a &lsquo;Seedee boy,&rsquo; as they call the stokers;
      he returned the full-blooded Sultan of Zanzibar&mdash;His Highness Sayyid
      Burgash, with a bottle in each hand. Then he sat on the fore-hatch
      grating, eating salt fish and onions, and singing the songs of a far
      country. The food belonged to Pambe, the Serang or head man of the lascar
      sailors. He had just cooked it for himself, turned to borrow some salt,
      and when he came back Nurkeed&rsquo;s dirty black fingers were spading into the
      rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A serang is a person of importance, far above a stoker, though the stoker
      draws better pay. He sets the chorus of &lsquo;Hya! Hulla! Hee-ah! Heh!&rsquo; when
      the captain&rsquo;s gig is pulled up to the davits; he heaves the lead too; and
      sometimes, when all the ship is lazy, he puts on his whitest muslin and a
      big red sash, and plays with the passengers&rsquo; children on the quarter-deck.
      Then the passengers give him money, and he saves it all up for an orgie at
      Bombay or Calcutta, or Pulu Penang. &lsquo;Ho! you fat black barrel, you&rsquo;re
      eating my food!&rsquo; said Pambe, in the Other Lingua Franca that begins where
      the Levant tongue stops, and runs from Port Said eastward till east is
      west, and the sealing-brigs of the Kurile Islands gossip with the strayed
      Hakodate junks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Son of Eblis, monkey-face, dried shark&rsquo;s liver, pigman, I am the Sultan
      Sayyid Burgash, and the commander of all this ship. Take away your
      garbage;&rsquo; and Nurkeed thrust the empty pewter rice-plate into Pambe&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pambe beat it into a basin over Nurkeed&rsquo;s woolly head. Nurkeed drew HIS
      sheath-knife and stabbed Pambe in the leg. Pambe drew his sheath-knife;
      but Nurkeed dropped down into the darkness of the hold and spat through
      the grating at Pambe, who was staining the clean fore-deck with his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the white moon saw these things; for the officers were looking after
      the coaling, and the passengers were tossing in their close cabins. &lsquo;All
      right,&rsquo; said Pambe&mdash;and went forward to tie up his leg&mdash;&lsquo;we will
      settle the account later on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a Malay born in India: married once in Burma, where his wife had a
      cigar-shop on the Shwe Dagon road; once in Singapore, to a Chinese girl;
      and once in Madras, to a Mahomedan woman who sold fowls. The English
      sailor cannot, owing to postal and telegraph facilities, marry as
      profusely as he used to do; but native sailors can, being uninfluenced by
      the barbarous inventions of the Western savage. Pambe was a good husband
      when he happened to remember the existence of a wife; but he was also a
      very good Malay; and it is not wise to offend a Malay, because he does not
      forget anything. Moreover, in Pambe&rsquo;s case blood had been drawn and food
      spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Nurkeed rose with a blank mind. He was no longer Sultan of
      Zanzibar, but a very hot stoker. So he went on deck and opened his jacket
      to the morning breeze, till a sheath-knife came like a flying-fish and
      stuck into the woodwork of the cook&rsquo;s galley half an inch from his right
      armpit. He ran down below before his time, trying to remember what he
      could have said to the owner of the weapon. At noon, when all the ship&rsquo;s
      lascars were feeding, Nurkeed advanced into their midst, and, being a
      placid man with a large regard for his own skin, he opened negotiations,
      saying, &lsquo;Men of the ship, last night I was drunk, and this morning I know
      that I behaved unseemly to some one or another of you. Who was that man,
      that I may meet him face to face and say that I was drunk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pambe measured the distance to Nurkeed&rsquo;s naked breast. If he sprang at him
      he might be tripped up, and a blind blow at the chest sometimes only means
      a gash on the breast-bone. Ribs are difficult to thrust between unless the
      subject be asleep. So he said nothing; nor did the other lascars. Their
      faces immediately dropped all expression, as is the custom of the Oriental
      when there is killing on the carpet or any chance of trouble. Nurkeed
      looked long at the white eyeballs. He was only an African, and could not
      read characters. A big sigh&mdash;almost a groan&mdash;broke from him, and
      he went back to the furnaces. The lascars took up the conversation where
      he had interrupted it. They talked of the best methods of cooking rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nurkeed suffered considerably from lack of fresh air during the run to
      Bombay. He only came on deck to breathe when all the world was about; and
      even then a heavy block once dropped from a derrick within a foot of his
      head, and an apparently firm-lashed grating on which he set his foot,
      began to turn over with the intention of dropping him on the cased cargo
      fifteen feet below; and one insupportable night the sheath-knife dropped
      from the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le, and this time it drew blood. So Nurkeed made
      complaint; and, when the Saarbruck reached Bombay, fled and buried himself
      among eight hundred thousand people, and did not sign articles till the
      ship had been a month gone from the port. Pambe waited too; but his Bombay
      wife grew clamorous, and he was forced to sign in the Spicheren to
      Hongkong, because he realised that all play and no work gives Jack a
      ragged shirt. In the foggy China seas he thought a great deal of Nurkeed,
      and, when Elsass-Lothringen steamers lay in port with the Spicheren,
      inquired after him and found he had gone to England via the Cape, on the
      Gravelotte. Pambe came to England on the Worth. The Spicheren met her by
      the Nore Light. Nurkeed was going out with the Spicheren to the Calicut
      coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want to find a friend, my trap-mouthed coal-scuttle?&rsquo; said a gentleman in
      the mercantile service. &lsquo;Nothing easier. Wait at the Nyanza Docks till he
      comes. Every one comes to the Nyanza Docks. Wait, you poor heathen.&rsquo; The
      gentleman spoke truth. There are three great doors in the world where, if
      you stand long enough, you shall meet any one you wish. The head of the
      Suez Canal is one, but there Death comes also; Charing Cross Station is
      the second&mdash;for inland work; and the Nyanza Docks is the third. At
      each of these places are men and women looking eternally for those who
      will surely come. So Pambe waited at the docks. Time was no object to him;
      and the wives could wait, as he did from day to day, week to week, and
      month to month, by the Blue Diamond funnels, the Red Dot smoke-stacks, the
      Yellow Streaks, and the nameless dingy gypsies of the sea that loaded and
      unloaded, jostled, whistled, and roared in the everlasting fog. When money
      failed, a kind gentleman told Pambe to become a Christian; and Pambe
      became one with great speed, getting his religious teachings between ship
      and ship&rsquo;s arrival, and six or seven shillings a week for distributing
      tracts to mariners. What the faith was Pambe did not in the least care;
      but he knew if he said &lsquo;Native Ki-lis-ti-an, Sar&rsquo; to men with long black
      coats he might get a few coppers; and the tracts were vendible at a little
      public-house that sold shag by the &lsquo;dottel,&rsquo; which is even smaller weight
      than the &lsquo;half-screw,&rsquo; which is less than the half-ounce, and a most
      profitable retail trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after eight months Pambe fell sick with pneumonia, contracted from
      long standing still in slush; and much against his will he was forced to
      lie down in his two-and-sixpenny room raging against Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind gentleman sat by his bedside, and grieved to find that Pambe
      talked in strange tongues, instead of listening to good books, and almost
      seemed to become a benighted heathen again&mdash;till one day he was
      roused from semi-stupor by a voice in the street by the dock-head. &lsquo;My
      friend&mdash;he,&rsquo; whispered Pambe. &lsquo;Call now&mdash;call Nurkeed. Quick!
      God has sent him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wanted one of his own race,&rsquo; said the kind gentleman; and, going out,
      he called &lsquo;Nurkeed!&rsquo; at the top of his voice. An excessively coloured man
      in a rasping white shirt and brand-new slops, a shining hat, and a
      breastpin, turned round. Many voyages had taught Nurkeed how to spend his
      money and made him a citizen of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hi! Yes!&rsquo; said he, when the situation was explained. &lsquo;Command him&mdash;black
      nigger&mdash;when I was in the Saarbruck. Ole Pambe, good ole Pambe. Dam
      lascar. Show him up, Sar;&rsquo; and he followed into the room. One glance told
      the stoker what the kind gentleman had overlooked. Pambe was desperately
      poor. Nurkeed drove his hands deep into his pockets, then advanced with
      clenched fists on the sick, shouting, &lsquo;Hya, Pambe. Hya! Hee-ah! Hulla!
      Heh! Takilo! Takilo! Make fast aft, Pambe. You know, Pambe. You know me.
      Dekho, jee! Look! Dam big fat lazy lascar!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pambe beckoned with his left hand. His right was under his pillow. Nurkeed
      removed his gorgeous hat and stooped over Pambe till he could catch a
      faint whisper. &lsquo;How beautiful!&rsquo; said the kind gentleman. &lsquo;How these
      Orientals love like children!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spit him out,&rsquo; said Nurkeed, leaning over Pambe yet more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Touching the matter of that fish and onions&mdash;&rsquo; said Pambe&mdash;and
      sent the knife home under the edge of the rib-bone upwards and forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a thick sick cough, and the body of the African slid slowly from
      the bed, his clutching hands letting fall a shower of silver pieces that
      ran across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I can die!&rsquo; said Pambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not die. He was nursed back to life with all the skill that
      money could buy, for the Law wanted him; and in the end he grew
      sufficiently healthy to be hanged in due and proper form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pambe did not care particularly; but it was a sad blow to the kind
      gentleman.

    <h2>
      LITTLE TOBRAH
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prisoner&rsquo;s head did not reach to the top of the dock,&rsquo; as the English
      newspapers say. This case, however, was not reported because nobody cared
      by so much as a hempen rope for the life or death of Little Tobrah. The
      assessors in the red court-house sat upon him all through the long hot
      afternoon, and whenever they asked him a question he salaamed and whined.
      Their verdict was that the evidence was inconclusive, and the Judge
      concurred. It was true that the dead body of Little Tobrah&rsquo;s sister had
      been found at the bottom of the well, and Little Tobrah was the only human
      being within a half mile radius at the time; but the child might have
      fallen in by accident. Therefore Little Tobrah was acquitted, and told to
      go where he pleased. This permission was not so generous as it sounds, for
      he had nowhere to go to, nothing in particular to eat, and nothing
      whatever to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trotted into the court-compound, and sat upon the well-kerb, wondering
      whether an unsuccessful dive into the black water below would end in a
      forced voyage across the other Black Water. A groom put down an emptied
      nose-bag on the bricks, and Little Tobrah, being hungry, set himself to
      scrape out what wet grain the horse had overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Thief&mdash;and but newly set free from the terror of the Law! Come
      along!&rsquo; said the groom, and Little Tobrah was led by the ear to a large
      and fat Englishman, who heard the tale of the theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; said the Englishman three times (only he said a stronger word).
      &lsquo;Put him into the net and take him home.&rsquo; So Little Tobrah was thrown into
      the net of the cart, and, nothing doubting that he should be stuck like a
      pig, was driven to the Englishman&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; said the Englishman as
      before. &lsquo;Wet grain, by Jove! Feed the little beggar, some of you, and
      we&rsquo;ll make a riding-boy of him! See? Wet grain, good Lord!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give an account of yourself,&rsquo; said the Head of the Grooms, to Little
      Tobrah after the meal had been eaten, and the servants lay at ease in
      their quarters behind the house. &lsquo;You are not of the groom caste, unless
      it be for the stomach&rsquo;s sake. How came you into the court, and why?
      Answer, little devil&rsquo;s spawn!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was not enough to eat,&rsquo; said Little Tobrah calmly. &lsquo;This is a good
      place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk straight talk,&rsquo; said the Head Groom, &lsquo;or I will make you clean out
      the stable of that large red stallion who bites like a camel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We be Telis, oil-pressers,&rsquo; said Little Tobrah, scratching his toes in
      the dust. &lsquo;We were Telis&mdash;my father, my mother, my brother, the elder
      by four years, myself, and the sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She who was found dead in the well?&rsquo; said one who had heard something of
      the trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; said Little Tobrah gravely. &lsquo;She who was found dead in the
      well. It befel upon a time, which is not in my memory, that the sickness
      came to the village where our oil-press stood, and first my sister was
      smitten as to her eyes, and went without sight, for it was mata&mdash;the
      smallpox. Thereafter, my father and my mother died of that same sickness,
      so we were alone&mdash;my brother who had twelve years, I who had eight,
      and the sister who could not see. Yet were there the bullock and the
      oil-press remaining, and we made shift to press the oil as before. But
      Surjun Dass, the grain-seller, cheated us in his dealings; and it was
      always a stubborn bullock to drive. We put marigold flowers for the Gods
      upon the neck of the bullock, and upon the great grinding-beam that rose
      through the roof; but we gained nothing thereby, and Surjun Dass was a
      hard man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bapri-bap,&rsquo; muttered the grooms&rsquo; wives, &lsquo;to cheat a child so! But WE know
      what the bunnia-folk are, sisters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The press was an old press, and we were not strong men&mdash;my brother
      and I; nor could we fix the neck of the beam firmly in the shackle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, indeed,&rsquo; said the gorgeously-clad wife of the Head Groom, joining
      the circle. &lsquo;That is a strong man&rsquo;s work. When I was a maid in my father&rsquo;s
      house&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, woman,&rsquo; said the Head Groom. &lsquo;Go on, boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; said Little Tobrah. &lsquo;The big beam tore down the roof upon
      a day which is not in my memory, and with the roof fell much of the hinder
      wall, and both together upon our bullock, whose back was broken. Thus we
      had neither home, nor press, nor bullock&mdash;my brother, myself, and the
      sister who was blind. We went crying away from that place, hand-in-hand,
      across the fields; and our money was seven annas and six pie. There was a
      famine in the land. I do not know the name of the land. So, on a night
      when we were sleeping, my brother took the five annas that remained to us
      and ran away. I do not know whither he went. The curse of my father be
      upon him. But I and the sister begged food in the villages, and there was
      none to give. Only all men said&mdash;&ldquo;Go to the Englishmen and they will
      give.&rdquo; I did not know what the Englishmen were; but they said that they
      were white, living in tents. I went forward; but I cannot say whither I
      went, and there was no more food for myself or the sister. And upon a hot
      night, she weeping and calling for food, we came to a well, and I bade her
      sit upon the kerb, and thrust her in, for, in truth, she could not see;
      and it is better to die than to starve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ai! Ahi!&rsquo; wailed the grooms&rsquo; wives in chorus; &lsquo;he thrust her in, for it
      is better to die than to starve!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would have thrown myself in also, but that she was not dead and called
      to me from the bottom of the well, and I was afraid and ran. And one came
      out of the crops saying that I had killed her and defiled the well, and
      they took me before an Englishman, white and terrible, living in a tent,
      and me he sent here. But there were no witnesses, and it is better to die
      than to starve. She, furthermore, could not see with her eyes, and was but
      a little child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was but a little child,&rsquo; echoed the Head Groom&rsquo;s wife. &lsquo;But who art thou,
      weak as a fowl and small as a day-old colt, what art THOU?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I who was empty am now full,&rsquo; said Little Tobrah, stretching himself upon
      the dust. &lsquo;And I would sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom&rsquo;s wife spread a cloth over him while Little Tobrah slept the
      sleep of the just.

    <h2>
      BUBBLING WELL ROAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Look out on a large scale map the place where the Chenab river falls into
      the Indus fifteen miles or so above the hamlet of Chachuran. Five miles
      west of Chachuran lies Bubbling Well Road, and the house of the gosain or
      priest of Arti-goth. It was the priest who showed me the road, but it is
      no thanks to him that I am able to tell this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five miles west of Chachuran is a patch of the plumed jungle-grass, that
      turns over in silver when the wind blows, from ten to twenty feet high and
      from three to four miles square. In the heart of the patch hides the
      gosain of Bubbling Well Road. The villagers stone him when he peers into
      the daylight, although he is a priest, and he runs back again as a strayed
      wolf turns into tall crops. He is a one-eyed man and carries, burnt
      between his brows, the impress of two copper coins. Some say that he was
      tortured by a native prince in the old days; for he is so old that he must
      have been capable of mischief in the days of Runjit Singh. His most
      pressing need at present is a halter, and the care of the British
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things happened when the jungle-grass was tall; and the villagers of
      Chachuran told me that a sounder of pig had gone into the Arti-goth patch.
      To enter jungle-grass is always an unwise proceeding, but I went, partly
      because I knew nothing of pig-hunting, and partly because the villagers
      said that the big boar of the sounder owned foot long tushes. Therefore I
      wished to shoot him, in order to produce the tushes in after years, and
      say that I had ridden him down in fair chase. I took a gun and went into
      the hot, close patch, believing that it would be an easy thing to unearth
      one pig in ten square miles of jungle. Mr. Wardle, the terrier, went with
      me because he believed that I was incapable of existing for an hour
      without his advice and countenance. He managed to slip in and out between
      the grass clumps, but I had to force my way, and in twenty minutes was as
      completely lost as though I had been in the heart of Central Africa. I did
      not notice this at first till I had grown wearied of stumbling and pushing
      through the grass, and Mr. Wardle was beginning to sit down very often and
      hang out his tongue very far. There was nothing but grass everywhere, and
      it was impossible to see two yards in any direction. The grass-stems held
      the heat exactly as boiler-tubes do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half-an-hour, when I was devoutly wishing that I had left the big boar
      alone, I came to a narrow path which seemed to be a compromise between a
      native foot-path and a pig-run. It was barely six inches wide, but I could
      sidle along it in comfort. The grass was extremely thick here, and where
      the path was ill defined it was necessary to crush into the tussocks
      either with both hands before the face, or to back into it, leaving both
      hands free to manage the rifle. None the less it was a path, and valuable
      because it might lead to a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of nearly fifty yards of fair way, just when I was preparing to
      back into an unusually stiff tussock, I missed Mr. Wardle, who for his
      girth is an unusually frivolous dog and never keeps to heel. I called him
      three times and said aloud, &lsquo;Where has the little beast gone to?&rsquo; Then I
      stepped backwards several paces, for almost under my feet a deep voice
      repeated, &lsquo;Where has the little beast gone?&rsquo; To appreciate an unseen voice
      thoroughly you should hear it when you are lost in stifling jungle-grass.
      I called Mr. Wardle again and the underground echo assisted me. At that I
      ceased calling and listened very attentively, because I thought I heard a
      man laughing in a peculiarly offensive manner. The heat made me sweat, but
      the laughter made me shake. There is no earthly need for laughter in high
      grass. It is indecent, as well as impolite. The chuckling stopped, and I
      took courage and continued to call till I thought that I had located the
      echo somewhere behind and below the tussock into which I was preparing to
      back just before I lost Mr. Wardle. I drove my rifle up to the triggers,
      between the grass-stems in a downward and forward direction. Then I
      waggled it to and fro, but it did not seem to touch ground on the far side
      of the tussock as it should have done. Every time that I grunted with the
      exertion of driving a heavy rifle through thick grass, the grunt was
      faithfully repeated from below, and when I stopped to wipe my face the
      sound of low laughter was distinct beyond doubting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the tussock, face first, an inch at a time, my mouth open and
      my eyes fine, full, and prominent. When I had overcome the resistance of
      the grass I found that I was looking straight across a black gap in the
      ground&mdash;that I was actually lying on my chest leaning over the mouth
      of a well so deep I could scarcely see the water in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were things in the water,&mdash;black things,&mdash;and the water
      was as black as pitch with blue scum atop. The laughing sound came from
      the noise of a little spring, spouting half-way down one side of the well.
      Sometimes as the black things circled round, the trickle from the spring
      fell upon their tightly-stretched skins, and then the laughter changed
      into a sputter of mirth. One thing turned over on its back, as I watched,
      and drifted round and round the circle of the mossy brickwork with a hand
      and half an arm held clear of the water in a stiff and horrible flourish,
      as though it were a very wearied guide paid to exhibit the beauties of the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not spend more than half-an-hour in creeping round that well and
      finding the path on the other side. The remainder of the journey I
      accomplished by feeling every foot of ground in front of me, and crawling
      like a snail through every tussock. I carried Mr. Wardle in my arms and he
      licked my nose. He was not frightened in the least, nor was I, but we
      wished to reach open ground in order to enjoy the view. My knees were
      loose, and the apple in my throat refused to slide up and down. The path
      on the far side of the well was a very good one, though boxed in on all
      sides by grass, and it led me in time to a priest&rsquo;s hut in the centre of a
      little clearing. When that priest saw my very white face coming through
      the grass he howled with terror and embraced my boots; but when I reached
      the bedstead set outside his door I sat down quickly and Mr. Wardle
      mounted guard over me. I was not in a condition to take care of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke I told the priest to lead me into the open, out of the
      Arti-goth patch, and to walk slowly in front of me. Mr. Wardle hates
      natives, and the priest was more afraid of Mr. Wardle than of me, though
      we were both angry. He walked very slowly down a narrow little path from
      his hut. That path crossed three paths, such as the one I had come by in
      the first instance, and every one of the three headed towards the Bubbling
      Well. Once when we stopped to draw breath, I heard the Well laughing to
      itself alone in the thick grass, and only my need for his services
      prevented my firing both barrels into the priest&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to the open the priest crashed back into cover, and I went to
      the village of Arti-goth for a drink. It was pleasant to be able to see
      the horizon all round, as well as the ground underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villagers told me that the patch of grass was full of devils and
      ghosts, all in the service of the priest, and that men and women and
      children had entered it and had never returned. They said the priest used
      their livers for purposes of witchcraft. When I asked why they had not
      told me of this at the outset, they said that they were afraid they would
      lose their reward for bringing news of the pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I left I did my best to set the patch alight, but the grass was too
      green. Some fine summer day, however, if the wind is favourable, a file of
      old newspapers and a box of matches will make clear the mystery of
      Bubbling Well Road.

    <h2>
      &lsquo;THE CITY OF DREADFUL NIGHT&rsquo; 
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The dense wet heat that hung over the face of land, like a blanket,
      prevented all hope of sleep in the first instance. The cicalas helped the
      heat; and the yelling jackals the cicalas. It was impossible to sit still
      in the dark, empty, echoing house and watch the punkah beat the dead air.
      So, at ten o&rsquo;clock of the night, I set my walking-stick on end in the
      middle of the garden, and waited to see how it would fall. It pointed
      directly down the moonlit road that leads to the City of Dreadful Night.
      The sound of its fall disturbed a hare. She limped from her form and ran
      across to a disused Mahomedan burial-ground, where the jawless skulls and
      rough-butted shank-bones, heartlessly exposed by the July rains, glimmered
      like mother o&rsquo; pearl on the rain-channelled soil. The heated air and the
      heavy earth had driven the very dead upward for coolness&rsquo; sake. The hare
      limped on; snuffed curiously at a fragment of a smoke-stained lamp-shard,
      and died out, in the shadow of a clump of tamarisk trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mat-weaver&rsquo;s hut under the lee of the Hindu temple was full of
      sleeping men who lay like sheeted corpses. Overhead blazed the unwinking
      eye of the Moon. Darkness gives at least a false impression of coolness.
      It was hard not to believe that the flood of light from above was warm.
      Not so hot as the Sun, but still sickly warm, and heating the heavy air
      beyond what was our due. Straight as a bar of polished steel ran the road
      to the City of Dreadful Night; and on either side of the road lay corpses
      disposed on beds in fantastic attitudes&mdash;one hundred and seventy
      bodies of men. Some shrouded all in white with bound-up mouths; some naked
      and black as ebony in the strong light; and one&mdash;that lay face
      upwards with dropped jaw, far away from the others&mdash;silvery white and
      ashen gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A leper asleep; and the remainder wearied coolies, servants, small
      shopkeepers, and drivers from the hackstand hard by. The scene&mdash;a
      main approach to Lahore city, and the night a warm one in August.&rsquo; This
      was all that there was to be seen; but by no means all that one could see.
      The witchery of the moonlight was everywhere; and the world was horribly
      changed. The long line of the naked dead, flanked by the rigid silver
      statue, was not pleasant to look upon. It was made up of men alone. Were
      the womenkind, then, forced to sleep in the shelter of the stifling
      mud-huts as best they might? The fretful wail of a child from a low
      mud-roof answered the question. Where the children are the mothers must be
      also to look after them. They need care on these sweltering nights. A
      black little bullet-head peeped over the coping, and a thin&mdash;a
      painfully thin&mdash;brown leg was slid over on to the gutter pipe. There
      was a sharp clink of glass bracelets; a woman&rsquo;s arm showed for an instant
      above the parapet, twined itself round the lean little neck, and the child
      was dragged back, protesting, to the shelter of the bedstead. His thin,
      high-pitched shriek died out in the thick air almost as soon as it was
      raised; for even the children of the soil found it too hot to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      More corpses; more stretches of moonlit, white road, a string of sleeping
      camels at rest by the wayside; a vision of scudding jackals; ekka-ponies
      asleep&mdash;the harness still on their backs, and the brass-studded
      country carts, winking in the moonlight&mdash;and again more corpses.
      Wherever a grain cart atilt, a tree trunk, a sawn log, a couple of bamboos
      and a few handfuls of thatch cast a shadow, the ground is covered with
      them. They lie&mdash;some face downwards, arms folded, in the dust; some
      with clasped hands flung up above their heads; some curled up dog-wise;
      some thrown like limp gunny-bags over the side of the grain carts; and
      some bowed with their brows on their knees in the full glare of the Moon.
      It would be a comfort if they were only given to snoring; but they are
      not, and the likeness to corpses is unbroken in all respects save one. The
      lean dogs snuff at them and turn away. Here and there a tiny child lies on
      his father&rsquo;s bedstead, and a protecting arm is thrown round it in every
      instance. But, for the most part, the children sleep with their mothers on
      the house-tops. Yellow-skinned white-toothed pariahs are not to be trusted
      within reach of brown bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stifling hot blast from the mouth of the Delhi Gate nearly ends my
      resolution of entering the City of Dreadful Night at this hour. It is a
      compound of all evil savours, animal and vegetable, that a walled city can
      brew in a day and a night. The temperature within the motionless groves of
      plantain and orange-trees outside the city walls seems chilly by
      comparison. Heaven help all sick persons and young children within the
      city to-night! The high house-walls are still radiating heat savagely, and
      from obscure side gullies fetid breezes eddy that ought to poison a
      buffalo. But the buffaloes do not heed. A drove of them are parading the
      vacant main street; stopping now and then to lay their ponderous muzzles
      against the closed shutters of a grain-dealer&rsquo;s shops and to blow thereon
      like grampuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then silence follows&mdash;the silence that is full of the night noises of
      a great city. A stringed instrument of some kind is just, and only just,
      audible. High overhead some one throws open a window, and the rattle of
      the wood-work echoes down the empty street. On one of the roofs, a hookah
      is in full blast; and the men are talking softly as the pipe gutters. A
      little farther on, the noise of conversation is more distinct. A slit of
      light shows itself between the sliding shutters of a shop. Inside, a
      stubble-bearded, weary-eyed trader is balancing his account-books among
      the bales of cotton prints that surround him. Three sheeted figures bear
      him company, and throw in a remark from time to time. First he makes an
      entry, then a remark; then passes the back of his hand across his
      streaming forehead. The heat in the built-in street is fearful. Inside the
      shops it must be almost unendurable. But the work goes on steadily; entry,
      guttural growl, and uplifted hand-stroke succeeding each other with the
      precision of clock-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A policeman&mdash;turbanless and fast asleep&mdash;lies across the road on
      the way to the Mosque of Wazir Khan. A bar of moonlight falls across the
      forehead and eyes of the sleeper, but he never stirs. It is close upon
      midnight, and the heat seems to be increasing. The open square in front of
      the Mosque is crowded with corpses; and a man must pick his way carefully
      for fear of treading on them. The moonlight stripes the Mosque&rsquo;s high
      front of coloured enamel work in broad diagonal bands; and each separate
      dreaming pigeon in the niches and corners of the masonry throws a squab
      little shadow. Sheeted ghosts rise up wearily from their pallets, and flit
      into the dark depths of the building. Is it possible to climb to the top
      of the great Minars, and thence to look down on the city? At all events
      the attempt is worth making, and the chances are that the door of the
      staircase will be unlocked. Unlocked it is; but a deeply sleeping janitor
      lies across the threshold, face turned to the Moon. A rat dashes out of
      his turban at the sound of approaching footsteps. The man grunts, opens
      his eyes for a minute, turns round, and goes to sleep again. All the heat
      of a decade of fierce Indian summers is stored in the pitch-black,
      polished walls of the corkscrew staircase. Half-way up, there is something
      alive, warm, and feathery; and it snores. Driven from step to step as it
      catches the sound of my advance, it flutters to the top and reveals itself
      as a yellow-eyed, angry kite. Dozens of kites are asleep on this and the
      other Minars, and on the domes below. There is the shadow of a cool, or at
      least a less sultry breeze at this height; and, refreshed thereby, turn to
      look on the City of Dreadful Night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dore might have drawn it! Zola could describe it&mdash;this spectacle of
      sleeping thousands in the moonlight and in the shadow of the Moon. The
      roof-tops are crammed with men, women, and children; and the air is full
      of undistinguishable noises. They are restless in the City of Dreadful
      Night; and small wonder. The marvel is that they can even breathe. If you
      gaze intently at the multitude, you can see that they are almost as uneasy
      as a daylight crowd; but the tumult is subdued. Everywhere, in the strong
      light, you can watch the sleepers turning to and fro; shifting their beds
      and again resettling them. In the pit-like court-yards of the houses there
      is the same movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pitiless Moon shows it all. Shows, too, the plains outside the city,
      and here and there a hand&rsquo;s-breadth of the Ravee without the walls. Shows
      lastly, a splash of glittering silver on a house-top almost directly below
      the mosque Minar. Some poor soul has risen to throw a jar of water over
      his fevered body; the tinkle of the falling water strikes faintly on the
      ear. Two or three other men, in far-off corners of the City of Dreadful
      Night, follow his example, and the water flashes like heliographic
      signals. A small cloud passes over the face of the Moon, and the city and
      its inhabitants&mdash;clear drawn in black and white before&mdash;fade
      into masses of black and deeper black. Still the unrestful noise
      continues, the sigh of a great city overwhelmed with the heat, and of a
      people seeking in vain for rest. It is only the lower-class women who
      sleep on the house-tops. What must the torment be in the latticed zenanas,
      where a few lamps are still twinkling? There are footfalls in the court
      below. It is the Muezzin&mdash;faithful minister; but he ought to have
      been here an hour ago to tell the Faithful that prayer is better than
      sleep&mdash;the sleep that will not come to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Muezzin fumbles for a moment with the door of one of the Minars,
      disappears awhile, and a bull-like roar&mdash;a magnificent bass thunder&mdash;tells
      that he has reached the top of the Minar. They must hear the cry to the
      banks of the shrunken Ravee itself! Even across the courtyard it is almost
      overpowering. The cloud drifts by and shows him outlined in black against
      the sky, hands laid upon his ears, and broad chest heaving with the play
      of his lungs&mdash;&lsquo;Allah ho Akbar&rsquo;; then a pause while another Muezzin
      somewhere in the direction of the Golden Temple takes up the call&mdash;&lsquo;Allah
      ho Akbar.&rsquo; Again and again; four times in all; and from the bedsteads a
      dozen men have risen up already.&mdash;&lsquo;I bear witness that there is no
      God but God.&rsquo; What a splendid cry it is, the proclamation of the creed
      that brings men out of their beds by scores at midnight! Once again he
      thunders through the same phrase, shaking with the vehemence of his own
      voice; and then, far and near, the night air rings with &lsquo;Mahomed is the
      Prophet of God.&rsquo; It is as though he were flinging his defiance to the
      far-off horizon, where the summer lightning plays and leaps like a bared
      sword. Every Muezzin in the city is in full cry, and some men on the
      roof-tops are beginning to kneel. A long pause precedes the last cry, &lsquo;La
      ilaha Illallah,&rsquo; and the silence closes up on it, as the ram on the head
      of a cotton-bale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Muezzin stumbles down the dark stairway grumbling in his beard. He
      passes the arch of the entrance and disappears. Then the stifling silence
      settles down over the City of Dreadful Night. The kites on the Minar sleep
      again, snoring more loudly, the hot breeze comes up in puffs and lazy
      eddies, and the Moon slides down towards the horizon. Seated with both
      elbows on the parapet of the tower, one can watch and wonder over that
      heat-tortured hive till the dawn. &lsquo;How do they live down there? What do
      they think of? When will they awake?&rsquo; More tinkling of sluiced water-pots;
      faint jarring of wooden bedsteads moved into or out of the shadows;
      uncouth music of stringed instruments softened by distance into a
      plaintive wail, and one low grumble of far-off thunder. In the courtyard
      of the mosque the janitor, who lay across the threshold of the Minar when
      I came up, starts wildly in his sleep, throws his hands above his head,
      mutters something, and falls back again. Lulled by the snoring of the
      kites&mdash;they snore like over-gorged humans&mdash;I drop off into an
      uneasy doze, conscious that three o&rsquo;clock has struck, and that there is a
      slight&mdash;a very slight&mdash;coolness in the atmosphere. The city is
      absolutely quiet now, but for some vagrant dog&rsquo;s love-song. Nothing save
      dead heavy sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several weeks of darkness pass after this. For the Moon has gone out. The
      very dogs are still, and I watch for the first light of the dawn before
      making my way homeward. Again the noise of shuffling feet. The morning
      call is about to begin, and my night watch is over. &lsquo;Allah ho Akbar! Allah
      ho Akbar!&rsquo; The east grows gray, and presently saffron; the dawn wind comes
      up as though the Muezzin had summoned it; and, as one man, the City of
      Dreadful Night rises from its bed and turns its face towards the dawning
      day. With return of life comes return of sound. First a low whisper, then
      a deep bass hum; for it must be remembered that the entire city is on the
      house-tops. My eyelids weighed down with the arrears of long deferred
      sleep, I escape from the Minar through the courtyard and out into the
      square beyond, where the sleepers have risen, stowed away the bedsteads,
      and are discussing the morning hookah. The minute&rsquo;s freshness of the air
      has gone, and it is as hot as at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will the Sahib, out of his kindness, make room?&rsquo; What is it? Something
      borne on men&rsquo;s shoulders comes by in the half-light, and I stand back. A
      woman&rsquo;s corpse going down to the burning-ghat, and a bystander says, &lsquo;She
      died at midnight from the heat.&rsquo; So the city was of Death as well as Night
      after all.

    <h2>
      GEORGIE PORGIE
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Georgie Porgie, pudding and pie,
     Kissed the girls and made them cry.
     When the girls came out to play
     Georgie Porgie ran away.
</pre>
    <p>
      If you will admit that a man has no right to enter his drawing-room early
      in the morning, when the housemaid is setting things right and clearing
      away the dust, you will concede that civilised people who eat out of china
      and own card-cases have no right to apply their standard of right and
      wrong to an unsettled land. When the place is made fit for their
      reception, by those men who are told off to the work, they can come up,
      bringing in their trunks their own society and the Decalogue, and all the
      other apparatus. Where the Queen&rsquo;s Law does not carry, it is irrational to
      expect an observance of other and weaker rules. The men who run ahead of
      the cars of Decency and Propriety, and make the jungle ways straight,
      cannot be judged in the same manner as the stay-at-home folk of the ranks
      of the regular Tchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many months ago the Queen&rsquo;s Law stopped a few miles north of Thayetmyo
      on the Irrawaddy. There was no very strong Public Opinion up to that
      limit, but it existed to keep men in order. When the Government said that
      the Queen&rsquo;s Law must carry up to Bhamo and the Chinese border the order
      was given, and some men whose desire was to be ever a little in advance of
      the rush of Respectability flocked forward with the troops. These were the
      men who could never pass examinations, and would have been too pronounced
      in their ideas for the administration of bureau-worked Provinces. The
      Supreme Government stepped in as soon as might be, with codes and
      regulations, and all but reduced New Burma to the dead Indian level; but
      there was a short time during which strong men were necessary and ploughed
      a field for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the fore-runners of Civilisation was Georgie Porgie, reckoned by all
      who knew him a strong man. He held an appointment in Lower Burma when the
      order came to break the Frontier, and his friends called him Georgie
      Porgie because of the singularly Burmese-like manner in which he sang a
      song whose first line is something like the words &lsquo;Georgie Porgie.&rsquo; Most
      men who have been in Burma will know the song. It means: &lsquo;Puff, puff,
      puff, puff, great steamboat!&rsquo; Georgie sang it to his banjo, and his
      friends shouted with delight, so that you could hear them far away in the
      teak-forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went to Upper Burma he had no special regard for God or Man, but
      he knew how to make himself respected, and to carry out the mixed
      Military-Civil duties that fell to most men&rsquo;s share in those months. He
      did his office work and entertained, now and again, the detachments of
      fever-shaken soldiers who blundered through his part of the world in
      search of a flying party of dacoits. Sometimes he turned out and dressed
      down dacoits on his own account; for the country was still smouldering and
      would blaze when least expected. He enjoyed these charivaris, but the
      dacoits were not so amused. All the officials who came in contact with him
      departed with the idea that Georgie Porgie was a valuable person, well
      able to take care of himself, and, on that belief, he was left to his own
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a few months he wearied of his solitude, and cast about for
      company and refinement. The Queen&rsquo;s Law had hardly begun to be felt in the
      country, and Public Opinion, which is more powerful than the Queen&rsquo;s Law,
      had yet to come. Also, there was a custom in the country which allowed a
      white man to take to himself a wife of the Daughters of Heth upon due
      payment. The marriage was not quite so binding as is the nikkah ceremony
      among Mahomedans, but the wife was very pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all our troops are back from Burma there will be a proverb in their
      mouths, &lsquo;As thrifty as a Burmese wife,&rsquo; and pretty English ladies will
      wonder what in the world it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headman of the village next to Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s post had a fair
      daughter who had seen Georgie Porgie and loved him from afar. When news
      went abroad that the Englishman with the heavy hand who lived in the
      stockade was looking for a housekeeper, the headman came in and explained
      that, for five hundred rupees down, he would entrust his daughter to
      Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s keeping, to be maintained in all honour, respect, and
      comfort, with pretty dresses, according to the custom of the country. This
      thing was done, and Georgie Porgie never repented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his rough-and-tumble house put straight and made comfortable, his
      hitherto unchecked expenses cut down by one half, and himself petted and
      made much of by his new acquisition, who sat at the head of his table and
      sang songs to him and ordered his Madrassee servants about, and was in
      every way as sweet and merry and honest and winning a little woman as the
      most exacting of bachelors could have desired. No race, men say who know,
      produces such good wives and heads of households as the Burmese. When the
      next detachment tramped by on the war-path the Subaltern in Command found
      at Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s table a hostess to be deferential to, a woman to be
      treated in every way as one occupying an assured position. When he
      gathered his men together next dawn and replunged into the jungle he
      thought regretfully of the nice little dinner and the pretty face, and
      envied Georgie Porgie from the bottom of his heart. Yet HE was engaged to
      a girl at Home, and that is how some men are constructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Burmese girl&rsquo;s name was not a pretty one; but as she was promptly
      christened Georgina by Georgie Porgie, the blemish did not matter. Georgie
      Porgie thought well of the petting and the general comfort, and vowed that
      he had never spent five hundred rupees to a better end.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three months of domestic life, a great idea struck him. Matrimony&mdash;English
      matrimony&mdash;could not be such a bad thing after all. If he were so
      thoroughly comfortable at the Back of Beyond with this Burmese girl who
      smoked cheroots, how much more comfortable would he be with a sweet
      English maiden who would not smoke cheroots, and would play upon a piano
      instead of a banjo? Also he had a desire to return to his kind, to hear a
      Band once more, and to feel how it felt to wear a dress-suit again.
      Decidedly, Matrimony would be a very good thing. He thought the matter out
      at length of evenings, while Georgina sang to him, or asked him why he was
      so silent, and whether she had done anything to offend him. As he thought,
      he smoked, and as he smoked he looked at Georgina, and in his fancy turned
      her into a fair, thrifty, amusing, merry, little English girl, with hair
      coming low down on her forehead, and perhaps a cigarette between her lips.
      Certainly, not a big, thick, Burma cheroot, of the brand that Georgina
      smoked. He would wed a girl with Georgina&rsquo;s eyes and most of her ways. But
      not all. She could be improved upon. Then he blew thick smoke-wreaths
      through his nostrils and stretched himself. He would taste marriage.
      Georgina had helped him to save money, and there were six months&rsquo; leave
      due to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See here, little woman,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we must put by more money for these
      next three months. I want it.&rsquo; That was a direct slur on Georgina&rsquo;s
      housekeeping; for she prided herself on her thrift; but since her God
      wanted money she would do her best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want money?&rsquo; she said with a little laugh. &lsquo;I HAVE money. Look!&rsquo; She
      ran to her own room and fetched out a small bag of rupees. &lsquo;Of all that
      you give me, I keep back some. See! One hundred and seven rupees. Can you
      want more money than that? Take it. It is my pleasure if you use it.&rsquo; She
      spread out the money on the table and pushed it towards him, with her
      quick, little, pale yellow fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie Porgie never referred to economy in the household again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months later, after the dispatch and receipt of several mysterious
      letters which Georgina could not understand, and hated for that reason,
      Georgie Porgie said that he was going away and she must return to her
      father&rsquo;s house and stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgina wept. She would go with her God from the world&rsquo;s end to the
      world&rsquo;s end. Why should she leave him? She loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am only going to Rangoon,&rsquo; said Georgie Porgie. &lsquo;I shall be back in a
      month, but it is safer to stay with your father. I will leave you two
      hundred rupees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you go for a month, what need of two hundred? Fifty are more than
      enough. There is some evil here. Do not go, or at least let me go with
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie Porgie does not like to remember that scene even at this date. In
      the end he got rid of Georgina by a compromise of seventy-five rupees. She
      would not take more. Then he went by steamer and rail to Rangoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious letters had granted him six months&rsquo; leave. The actual
      flight and an idea that he might have been treacherous hurt severely at
      the time, but as soon as the big steamer was well out into the blue,
      things were easier, and Georgina&rsquo;s face, and the queer little stockaded
      house, and the memory of the rushes of shouting dacoits by night, the cry
      and struggle of the first man that he had ever killed with his own hand,
      and a hundred other more intimate things, faded and faded out of Georgie
      Porgie&rsquo;s heart, and the vision of approaching England took its place. The
      steamer was full of men on leave, all rampantly jovial souls who had
      shaken off the dust and sweat of Upper Burma and were as merry as
      schoolboys. They helped Georgie Porgie to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came England with its luxuries and decencies and comforts, and
      Georgie Porgie walked in a pleasant dream upon pavements of which he had
      nearly forgotten the ring, wondering why men in their senses ever left
      Town. He accepted his keen delight in his furlough as the reward of his
      services. Providence further arranged for him another and greater delight&mdash;all
      the pleasures of a quiet English wooing, quite different from the brazen
      businesses of the East, when half the community stand back and bet on the
      result, and the other half wonder what Mrs. So-and-So will say to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant girl and a perfect summer, and a big country-house near
      Petworth where there are acres and acres of purple heather and
      high-grassed water-meadows to wander through. Georgie Porgie felt that he
      had at last found something worth the living for, and naturally assumed
      that the next thing to do was to ask the girl to share his life in India.
      She, in her ignorance, was willing to go. On this occasion there was no
      bartering with a village headman. There was a fine middle-class wedding in
      the country, with a stout Papa and a weeping Mamma, and a best-man in
      purple and fine linen, and six snub-nosed girls from the Sunday School to
      throw roses on the path between the tombstones up to the Church door. The
      local paper described the affair at great length, even down to giving the
      hymns in full. But that was because the Direction were starving for want
      of material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a honeymoon at Arundel, and the Mamma wept copiously before she
      allowed her one daughter to sail away to India under the care of Georgie
      Porgie the Bridegroom. Beyond any question, Georgie Porgie was immensely
      fond of his wife, and she was devoted to him as the best and greatest man
      in the world. When he reported himself at Bombay he felt justified in
      demanding a good station for his wife&rsquo;s sake; and, because he had made a
      little mark in Burma and was beginning to be appreciated, they allowed him
      nearly all that he asked for, and posted him to a station which we will
      call Sutrain. It stood upon several hills, and was styled officially a
      &lsquo;Sanitarium,&rsquo; for the good reason that the drainage was utterly neglected.
      Here Georgie Porgie settled down, and found married life come very
      naturally to him. He did not rave, as do many bridegrooms, over the
      strangeness and delight of seeing his own true love sitting down to
      breakfast with him every morning &lsquo;as though it were the most natural thing
      in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had been there before,&rsquo; as the Americans say, and, checking the merits
      of his own present Grace by those of Georgina, he was more and more
      inclined to think that he had done well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no peace or comfort across the Bay of Bengal, under the
      teak-trees where Georgina lived with her father, waiting for Georgie
      Porgie to return. The headman was old, and remembered the war of &lsquo;51. He
      had been to Rangoon, and knew something of the ways of the Kullahs.
      Sitting in front of his door in the evenings, he taught Georgina a dry
      philosophy which did not console her in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble was that she loved Georgie Porgie just as much as the French
      girl in the English History books loved the priest whose head was broken
      by the king&rsquo;s bullies. One day she disappeared from the village with all
      the rupees that Georgie Porgie had given her, and a very small smattering
      of English&mdash;also gained from Georgie Porgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headman was angry at first, but lit a fresh cheroot and said something
      uncomplimentary about the sex in general. Georgina had started on a search
      for Georgie Porgie, who might be in Rangoon, or across the Black Water, or
      dead, for aught that she knew. Chance favoured her. An old Sikh policeman
      told her that Georgie Porgie had crossed the Black Water. She took a
      steerage-passage from Rangoon and went to Calcutta; keeping the secret of
      her search to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In India every trace of her was lost for six weeks, and no one knows what
      trouble of heart she must have undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reappeared, four hundred miles north of Calcutta, steadily heading
      northwards, very worn and haggard, but very fixed in her determination to
      find Georgie Porgie. She could not understand the language of the people;
      but India is infinitely charitable, and the women-folk along the Grand
      Trunk gave her food. Something made her believe that Georgie Porgie was to
      be found at the end of that pitiless road. She may have seen a sepoy who
      knew him in Burma, but of this no one can be certain. At last, she found a
      regiment on the line of march, and met there one of the many subalterns
      whom Georgie Porgie had invited to dinner in the far-off, old days of the
      dacoit-hunting. There was a certain amount of amusement among the tents
      when Georgina threw herself at the man&rsquo;s feet and began to cry. There was
      no amusement when her story was told; but a collection was made, and that
      was more to the point. One of the subalterns knew of Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s
      whereabouts, but not of his marriage. So he told Georgina and she went her
      way joyfully to the north, in a railway carriage where there was rest for
      tired feet and shade for a dusty little head. The marches from the train
      through the hills into Sutrain were trying, but Georgina had money, and
      families journeying in bullock-carts gave her help. It was an almost
      miraculous journey, and Georgina felt sure that the good spirits of Burma
      were looking after her. The hill-road to Sutrain is a chilly stretch, and
      Georgina caught a bad cold. Still there was Georgie Porgie at the end of
      all the trouble to take her up in his arms and pet her, as he used to do
      in the old days when the stockade was shut for the night and he had
      approved of the evening meal. Georgina went forward as fast as she could;
      and her good spirits did her one last favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Englishman stopped her, in the twilight, just at the turn of the road
      into Sutrain, saying, &lsquo;Good Heavens! What are you doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was Gillis, the man who had been Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s assistant in Upper
      Burma, and who occupied the next post to Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s in the jungle.
      Georgie Porgie had applied to have him to work with at Sutrain because he
      liked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come,&rsquo; said Georgina simply. &lsquo;It was such a long way, and I have
      been months in coming. Where is his house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillis gasped. He had seen enough of Georgina in the old times to know
      that explanations would be useless. You cannot explain things to the
      Oriental. You must show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take you there,&rsquo; said Gillis, and he led Georgina off the road, up
      the cliff, by a little pathway, to the back of a house set on a platform
      cut into the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamps were just lit, but the curtains were not drawn. &lsquo;Now look,&rsquo; said
      Gillis, stopping in front of the drawing-room window. Georgina looked and
      saw Georgie Porgie and the Bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand up to her hair, which had come out of its top-knot and
      was straggling about her face. She tried to set her ragged dress in order,
      but the dress was past pulling straight, and she coughed a queer little
      cough, for she really had taken a very bad cold. Gillis looked, too, but
      while Georgina only looked at the Bride once, turning her eyes always on
      Georgie Porgie, Gillis looked at the Bride all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; said Gillis, who held Georgina by the wrist,
      in case of any unexpected rush into the lamplight. &lsquo;Will you go in and
      tell that English woman that you lived with her husband?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Georgina faintly. &lsquo;Let me go. I am going away. I swear that I
      am going away.&rsquo; She twisted herself free and ran off into the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little beast!&rsquo; said Gillis, dropping on to the main road. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      given her something to get back to Burma with. What a narrow shave though!
      And that angel would never have forgiven it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems to prove that the devotion of Gillis was not entirely due to
      his affection for Georgie Porgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bride and the Bridegroom came out into the verandah after dinner, in
      order that the smoke of Georgie Porgie&rsquo;s cheroots might not hang in the
      new drawing-room curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that noise down there?&rsquo; said the Bride. Both listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Georgie Porgie, &lsquo;I suppose some brute of a hillman has been
      beating his wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beating&mdash;his&mdash;wife! How ghastly!&rsquo; said the Bride. &lsquo;Fancy YOUR
      beating ME!&rsquo; She slipped an arm round her husband&rsquo;s waist, and, leaning
      her head against his shoulder, looked out across the cloud-filled valley
      in deep content and security.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Georgina crying, all by herself, down the hillside, among the
      stones of the water-course where the washermen wash the clothes.

    <h2>
      NABOTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how it happened; and the truth is also an allegory of Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met him at the corner of my garden, an empty basket on his head, and an
      unclean cloth round his loins. That was all the property to which Naboth
      had the shadow of a claim when I first saw him. He opened our acquaintance
      by begging. He was very thin and showed nearly as many ribs as his basket;
      and he told me a long story about fever and a lawsuit, and an iron
      cauldron that had been seized by the court in execution of a decree. I put
      my hand into my pocket to help Naboth, as kings of the East have helped
      alien adventurers to the loss of their kingdoms. A rupee had hidden in my
      waistcoat lining. I never knew it was there, and gave the trove to Naboth
      as a direct gift from Heaven. He replied that I was the only legitimate
      Protector of the Poor he had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he reappeared, a little fatter in the round, and curled
      himself into knots in the front verandah. He said I was his father and his
      mother, and the direct descendant of all the gods in his Pantheon, besides
      controlling the destinies of the universe. He himself was but a
      sweetmeat-seller, and much less important than the dirt under my feet. I
      had heard this sort of thing before, so I asked him what he wanted. My
      rupee, quoth Naboth, had raised him to the ever-lasting heavens, and he
      wished to prefer a request. He wished to establish a sweetmeat-pitch near
      the house of his benefactor, to gaze on my revered countenance as I went
      to and fro illumining the world. I was graciously pleased to give
      permission, and he went away with his head between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the far end of my garden, the ground slopes toward the public road,
      and the slope is crowned with a thick shrubbery. There is a short
      carriage-road from the house to the Mall, which passes close to the
      shrubbery. Next afternoon I saw that Naboth had seated himself at the
      bottom of the slope, down in the dust of the public road, and in the full
      glare of the sun, with a starved basket of greasy sweets in front of him.
      He had gone into trade once more on the strength of my munificent
      donation, and the ground was as Paradise by my honoured favour. Remember,
      there was only Naboth, his basket, the sunshine, and the gray dust when
      the sap of my Empire first began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he had moved himself up the slope nearer to my shrubbery, and
      waved a palm-leaf fan to keep the flies off the sweets. So I judged that
      he must have done a fair trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later I noticed that he had backed himself and his basket under
      the shadow of the shrubbery, and had tied an Isabella-coloured rag between
      two branches in order to make more shade. There were plenty of sweets in
      his basket. I thought that trade must certainly be looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven weeks later the Government took up a plot of ground for a Chief
      Court close to the end of my compound, and employed nearly four hundred
      coolies on the foundations. Naboth bought a blue and white striped
      blanket, a brass lamp-stand, and a small boy, to cope with the rush of
      trade, which was tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days later he bought a huge, fat, red-backed account-book, and a
      glass inkstand. Thus I saw that the coolies had been getting into his
      debt, and that commerce was increasing on legitimate lines of credit. Also
      I saw that the one basket had grown into three, and that Naboth had backed
      and hacked into the shrubbery, and made himself a nice little clearing for
      the proper display of the basket, the blanket, the books, and the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One week and five days later he had built a mud fire-place in the
      clearing, and the fat account-book was overflowing. He said that God
      created few Englishmen of my kind, and that I was the incarnation of all
      human virtues. He offered me some of his sweets as tribute, and by
      accepting these I acknowledged him as my feudatory under the skirt of my
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks later I noticed that the boy was in the habit of cooking
      Naboth&rsquo;s mid-day meal for him, and Naboth was beginning to grow a stomach.
      He had hacked away more of my shrubbery and owned another and a fatter
      account-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleven weeks later Naboth had eaten his way nearly through that shrubbery,
      and there was a reed hut with a bedstead outside it, standing in the
      little glade that he had eroded. Two dogs and a baby slept on the
      bedstead. So I fancied Naboth had taken a wife. He said that he had, by my
      favour, done this thing, and that I was several times finer than Krishna.
      Six weeks and two days later a mud wall had grown up at the back of the
      hut. There were fowls in front and it smelt a little. The Municipal
      Secretary said that a cess-pool was forming in the public road from the
      drainage of my compound, and that I must take steps to clear it away. I
      spoke to Naboth. He said I was Lord Paramount of his earthly concerns, and
      the garden was all my own property, and sent me some more sweets in a
      second-hand duster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months later a coolie bricklayer was killed in a scuffle that took
      place opposite Naboth&rsquo;s Vineyard. The Inspector of Police said it was a
      serious case; went into my servants&rsquo; quarters; insulted my butler&rsquo;s wife,
      and wanted to arrest my butler. The curious thing about the murder was
      that most of the coolies were drunk at the time. Naboth pointed out that
      my name was a strong shield between him and his enemies, and he expected
      that another baby would be born to him shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four months later the hut was ALL mud walls, very solidly built, and
      Naboth had used most of my shrubbery for his five goats. A silver watch
      and an aluminium chain shone upon his very round stomach. My servants were
      alarmingly drunk several times, and used to waste the day with Naboth when
      they got the chance. I spoke to Naboth. He said, by my favour and the
      glory of my countenance, he would make all his women-folk ladies, and that
      if any one hinted that he was running an illicit still under the shadow of
      the tamarisks, why, I, his Suzerain, was to prosecute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he hired a man to make several dozen square yards of
      trellis-work to put around the back of his hut, that his women-folk might
      be screened from the public gaze. The man went away in the evening, and
      left his day&rsquo;s work to pave the short cut from the public road to my
      house. I was driving home in the dusk, and turned the corner by Naboth&rsquo;s
      Vineyard quickly. The next thing I knew was that the horses of the phaeton
      were stamping and plunging in the strongest sort of bamboo net-work. Both
      beasts came down. One rose with nothing more than chipped knees. The other
      was so badly kicked that I was forced to shoot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naboth is gone now, and his hut is ploughed into its native mud with
      sweetmeats instead of salt for a sign that the place is accursed. I have
      built a summer-house to overlook the end of the garden, and it is as a
      fort on my frontier whence I guard my Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know exactly how Ahab felt. He has been shamefully misrepresented in the
      Scriptures.

    <h2>
      THE DREAM OF DUNCAN PARRENNESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Copyright, 1891, by MACMILLAN &amp; Co.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Mr. Bunyan of old, I, Duncan Parrenness, Writer to the Most
      Honourable the East India Company, in this God-forgotten city of Calcutta,
      have dreamed a dream, and never since that Kitty my mare fell lame have I
      been so troubled. Therefore, lest I should forget my dream, I have made
      shift to set it down here. Though Heaven knows how unhandy the pen is to
      me who was always readier with sword than ink-horn when I left London two
      long years since.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Governor-General&rsquo;s great dance (that he gives yearly at the
      latter end of November) was finisht, I had gone to mine own room which
      looks over that sullen, un-English stream, the Hoogly, scarce so sober as
      I might have been. Now, roaring drunk in the West is but fuddled in the
      East, and I was drunk Nor&rsquo;-Nor&rsquo; Easterly as Mr. Shakespeare might have
      said. Yet, in spite of my liquor, the cool night winds (though I have
      heard that they breed chills and fluxes innumerable) sobered me somewhat;
      and I remembered that I had been but a little wrung and wasted by all the
      sicknesses of the past four months, whereas those young bloods that came
      eastward with me in the same ship had been all, a month back, planted to
      Eternity in the foul soil north of Writers&rsquo; Buildings. So then, I thanked
      God mistily (though, to my shame, I never kneeled down to do so) for
      license to live, at least till March should be upon us again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, we that were alive (and our number was less by far than those who
      had gone to their last account in the hot weather late past) had made very
      merry that evening, by the ramparts of the Fort, over this kindness of
      Providence; though our jests were neither witty nor such as I should have
      liked my Mother to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had lain down (or rather thrown me on my bed) and the fumes of my
      drink had a little cleared away, I found that I could get no sleep for
      thinking of a thousand things that were better left alone. First, and it
      was a long time since I had thought of her, the sweet face of Kitty
      Somerset, drifted, as it might have been drawn in a picture, across the
      foot of my bed, so plainly, that I almost thought she had been present in
      the body. Then I remembered how she drove me to this accursed country to
      get rich, that I might the more quickly marry her, our parents on both
      sides giving their consent; and then how she thought better (or worse may
      be) of her troth, and wed Tom Sanderson but a short three months after I
      had sailed. From Kitty I fell a-musing on Mrs. Vansuythen, a tall pale
      woman with violet eyes that had come to Calcutta from the Dutch Factory at
      Chinsura, and had set all our young men, and not a few of the factors, by
      the ears. Some of our ladies, it is true, said that she had never a
      husband or marriage-lines at all; but women, and specially those who have
      led only indifferent good lives themselves, are cruel hard one on another.
      Besides, Mrs. Vansuythen was far prettier than them all. She had been most
      gracious to me at the Governor-General&rsquo;s rout, and indeed I was looked
      upon by all as her preux chevalier&mdash;which is French for a much worse
      word. Now, whether I cared so much as the scratch of a pin for this same
      Mrs. Vansuythen (albeit I had vowed eternal love three days after we met)
      I knew not then nor did till later on; but mine own pride, and a skill in
      the small sword that no man in Calcutta could equal, kept me in her
      affections. So that I believed I worshipt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had dismist her violet eyes from my thoughts, my reason reproacht
      me for ever having followed her at all; and I saw how the one year that I
      had lived in this land had so burnt and seared my mind with the flames of
      a thousand bad passions and desires, that I had aged ten months for each
      one in the Devil&rsquo;s school. Whereat I thought of my Mother for a while, and
      was very penitent: making in my sinful tipsy mood a thousand vows of
      reformation&mdash;all since broken, I fear me, again and again. To-morrow,
      says I to myself, I will live cleanly for ever. And I smiled dizzily (the
      liquor being still strong in me) to think of the dangers I had escaped;
      and built all manner of fine Castles in Spain, whereof a shadowy Kitty
      Somerset that had the violet eyes and the sweet slow speech of Mrs.
      Vansuythen, was always Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a very fine and magnificent courage (that doubtless had its birth
      in Mr. Hastings&rsquo; Madeira) grew upon me, till it seemed that I could become
      Governor-General, Nawab, Prince, ay, even the Great Mogul himself, by the
      mere wishing of it. Wherefore, taking my first steps, random and unstable
      enough, towards my new kingdom, I kickt my servants sleeping without till
      they howled and ran from me, and called Heaven and Earth to witness that
      I, Duncan Parrenness, was a Writer in the service of the Company and
      afraid of no man. Then, seeing that neither the Moon nor the Great Bear
      were minded to accept my challenge, I lay down again and must have fallen
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was waked presently by my last words repeated two or three times, and I
      saw that there had come into the room a drunken man, as I thought, from
      Mr. Hastings&rsquo; rout. He sate down at the foot of my bed in all the world as
      it belonged to him, and I took note, as well as I could, that his face was
      somewhat like mine own grown older, save when it changed to the face of
      the Governor-General or my father, dead these six months. But this seemed
      to me only natural, and the due result of too much wine; and I was so
      angered at his entry all unannounced, that I told him, not over civilly,
      to go. To all my words he made no answer whatever, only saying slowly, as
      though it were some sweet morsel: &lsquo;Writer in the Company&rsquo;s service and
      afraid of no man.&rsquo; Then he stops short, and turning round sharp upon me,
      says that one of my kidney need fear neither man nor devil; that I was a
      brave young man, and like enough, should I live so long, to be
      Governor-General. But for all these things (and I suppose that he meant
      thereby the changes and chances of our shifty life in these parts) I must
      pay my price. By this time I had sobered somewhat, and being well waked
      out of my first sleep, was disposed to look upon the matter as a tipsy
      man&rsquo;s jest. So, says I merrily: &lsquo;And what price shall I pay for this
      palace of mine, which is but twelve feet square, and my five poor pagodas
      a month? The Devil take you and your jesting: I have paid my price twice
      over in sickness.&rsquo; At that moment my man turns full towards me: so that by
      the moonlight I could see every line and wrinkle of his face. Then my
      drunken mirth died out of me, as I have seen the waters of our great
      rivers die away in one night; and I, Duncan Parrenness, who was afraid of
      no man, was taken with a more deadly terror than I hold it has ever been
      the lot of mortal man to know. For I saw that his face was my very own,
      but marked and lined and scarred with the furrows of disease and much evil
      living&mdash;as I once, when I was (Lord help me) very drunk indeed, have
      seen mine own face, all white and drawn and grown old, in a mirror. I take
      it that any man would have been even more greatly feared than I. For I am
      in no way wanting in courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had lain still for a little, sweating in my agony and waiting
      until I should awake from this terrible dream (for dream I knew it to be)
      he says again, that I must pay my price, and a little after, as though it
      were to be given in pagodas and sicca rupees: &lsquo;What price will you pay?&rsquo; 
      Says I, very softly: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let me be, whoever you are, and I
      will mend my ways from to-night.&rsquo; Says he, laughing a little at my words,
      but otherwise making no motion of having heard them: &lsquo;Nay, I would only
      rid so brave a young ruffler as yourself of much that will be a great
      hindrance to you on your way through life in the Indies; for believe me,&rsquo; 
      and here he looks full on me once more, &lsquo;there is no return.&rsquo; At all this
      rigmarole, which I could not then understand, I was a good deal put aback
      and waited for what should come next. Says he very calmly, &lsquo;Give me your
      trust in man.&rsquo; At that I saw how heavy would be my price, for I never
      doubted but that he could take from me all that he asked, and my head was,
      through terror and wakefulness, altogether cleared of the wine I had
      drunk. So I takes him up very short, crying that I was not so wholly bad
      as he would make believe, and that I trusted my fellows to the full as
      much as they were worthy of it. &lsquo;It was none of my fault,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if one
      half of them were liars and the other half deserved to be burnt in the
      hand, and I would once more ask him to have done with his questions.&rsquo; Then
      I stopped, a little afraid, it is true, to have let my tongue so run away
      with me, but he took no notice of this, and only laid his hand lightly on
      my left breast and I felt very cold there for a while. Then he says,
      laughing more: &lsquo;Give me your faith in women.&rsquo; At that I started in my bed
      as though I had been stung, for I thought of my sweet mother in England,
      and for a while fancied that my faith in God&rsquo;s best creatures could
      neither be shaken nor stolen from me. But later, Myself&rsquo;s hard eyes being
      upon me, I fell to thinking, for the second time that night, of Kitty (she
      that jilted me and married Tom Sanderson) and of Mistress Vansuythen, whom
      only my devilish pride made me follow, and how she was even worse than
      Kitty, and I worst of them all&mdash;seeing that with my life&rsquo;s work to be
      done, I must needs go dancing down the Devil&rsquo;s swept and garnished
      causeway, because, forsooth, there was a light woman&rsquo;s smile at the end of
      it. And I thought that all women in the world were either like Kitty or
      Mistress Vansuythen (as indeed they have ever since been to me) and this
      put me to such an extremity of rage and sorrow, that I was beyond word
      glad when Myself&rsquo;s hand fell again on my left breast, and I was no more
      troubled by these follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he was silent for a little, and I made sure that he must go or
      I awake ere long: but presently he speaks again (and very softly) that I
      was a fool to care for such follies as those he had taken from me, and
      that ere he went he would only ask me for a few other trifles such as no
      man, or for matter of that boy either, would keep about him in this
      country. And so it happened that he took from out of my very heart as it
      were, looking all the time into my face with my own eyes, as much as
      remained to me of my boy&rsquo;s soul and conscience. This was to me a far more
      terrible loss than the two that I had suffered before. For though, Lord
      help me, I had travelled far enough from all paths of decent or godly
      living, yet there was in me, though I myself write it, a certain goodness
      of heart which, when I was sober (or sick) made me very sorry of all that
      I had done before the fit came on me. And this I lost wholly: having in
      place thereof another deadly coldness at the heart. I am not, as I have
      before said, ready with my pen, so I fear that what I have just written
      may not be readily understood. Yet there be certain times in a young man&rsquo;s
      life, when, through great sorrow or sin, all the boy in him is burnt and
      seared away so that he passes at one step to the more sorrowful state of
      manhood: as our staring Indian day changes into night with never so much
      as the gray of twilight to temper the two extremes. This shall perhaps
      make my state more clear, if it be remembered that my torment was ten
      times as great as comes in the natural course of nature to any man. At
      that time I dared not think of the change that had come over me, and all
      in one night: though I have often thought of it since. &lsquo;I have paid the
      price,&rsquo; says I, my teeth chattering, for I was deadly cold, &lsquo;and what is
      my return?&rsquo; At this time it was nearly dawn, and Myself had begun to grow
      pale and thin against the white light in the east, as my mother used to
      tell me is the custom of ghosts and devils and the like. He made as if he
      would go, but my words stopt him and he laughed&mdash;as I remember that I
      laughed when I ran Angus Macalister through the sword-arm last August,
      because he said that Mrs. Vansuythen was no better than she should be.
      &lsquo;What return?&rsquo;&mdash;says he, catching up my last words&mdash;&lsquo;Why,
      strength to live as long as God or the Devil pleases, and so long as you
      live my young master, my gift.&rsquo; With that he puts something into my hand,
      though it was still too dark to see what it was, and when next I lookt up
      he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the light came I made shift to behold his gift, and saw that it was a
      little piece of dry bread.

      THE INCARNATION OF KRISHNA MULVANEY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Wohl auf, my bully cavaliers,
   We ride to church to-day,
 The man that hasn&rsquo;t got a horse
   Must steal one straight away.

 Be reverent, men, remember
   This is a Gottes haus.
 Du, Conrad, cut along der aisle
   And schenck der whiskey aus.
                  HANS BREITMANN&rsquo;S RIDE TO CHURCH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, very far from England, there lived three men who loved
      each other so greatly that neither man nor woman could come between them.
      They were in no sense refined, nor to be admitted to the outer-door mats
      of decent folk, because they happened to be private soldiers in Her
      Majesty&rsquo;s Army; and private soldiers of our service have small time for
      self-culture. Their duty is to keep themselves and their accoutrements
      specklessly clean, to refrain from getting drunk more often than is
      necessary, to obey their superiors, and to pray for a war. All these
      things my friends accomplished; and of their own motion threw in some
      fighting-work for which the Army Regulations did not call. Their fate sent
      them to serve in India, which is not a golden country, though poets have
      sung otherwise. There men die with great swiftness, and those who live
      suffer many and curious things. I do not think that my friends concerned
      themselves much with the social or political aspects of the East. They
      attended a not unimportant war on the northern frontier, another one on
      our western boundary, and a third in Upper Burma. Then their regiment sat
      still to recruit, and the boundless monotony of cantonment life was their
      portion. They were drilled morning and evening on the same dusty
      parade-ground. They wandered up and down the same stretch of dusty white
      road, attended the same church and the same grog-shop, and slept in the
      same lime-washed barn of a barrack for two long years. There was Mulvaney,
      the father in the craft, who had served with various regiments from
      Bermuda to Halifax, old in war, scarred, reckless, resourceful, and in his
      pious hours an unequalled soldier. To him turned for help and comfort six
      and a half feet of slow-moving, heavy-footed Yorkshireman, born on the
      wolds, bred in the dales, and educated chiefly among the carriers&rsquo; carts
      at the back of York railway-station. His name was Learoyd, and his chief
      virtue an unmitigated patience which helped him to win fights. How
      Ortheris, a fox-terrier of a Cockney, ever came to be one of the trio, is
      a mystery which even to-day I cannot explain. &lsquo;There was always three av
      us,&rsquo; Mulvaney used to say. &lsquo;An&rsquo; by the grace av God, so long as our
      service lasts, three av us they&rsquo;ll always be. &lsquo;Tis betther so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They desired no companionship beyond their own, and it was evil for any
      man of the regiment who attempted dispute with them. Physical argument was
      out of the question as regarded Mulvaney and the Yorkshireman; and assault
      on Ortheris meant a combined attack from these twain&mdash;a business
      which no five men were anxious to have on their hands. Therefore they
      flourished, sharing their drinks, their tobacco, and their money; good
      luck and evil; battle and the chances of death; life and the chances of
      happiness from Calicut in southern, to Peshawur in northern India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through no merit of my own it was my good fortune to be in a measure
      admitted to their friendship&mdash;frankly by Mulvaney from the beginning,
      sullenly and with reluctance by Learoyd, and suspiciously by Ortheris, who
      held to it that no man not in the Army could fraternise with a red-coat.
      &lsquo;Like to like,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a bloomin&rsquo; sodger&mdash;he&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo; 
      civilian. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t natural&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not all. They thawed progressively, and in the thawing told
      me more of their lives and adventures than I am ever likely to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Omitting all else, this tale begins with the Lamentable Thirst that was at
      the beginning of First Causes. Never was such a thirst&mdash;Mulvaney told
      me so. They kicked against their compulsory virtue, but the attempt was
      only successful in the case of Ortheris. He, whose talents were many, went
      forth into the highways and stole a dog from a &lsquo;civilian&rsquo;&mdash;videlicet,
      some one, he knew not who, not in the Army. Now that civilian was but
      newly connected by marriage with the colonel of the regiment, and outcry
      was made from quarters least anticipated by Ortheris, and, in the end, he
      was forced, lest a worse thing should happen, to dispose at ridiculously
      unremunerative rates of as promising a small terrier as ever graced one
      end of a leading string. The purchase-money was barely sufficient for one
      small outbreak which led him to the guard-room. He escaped, however, with
      nothing worse than a severe reprimand, and a few hours of punishment
      drill. Not for nothing had he acquired the reputation of being &lsquo;the best
      soldier of his inches&rsquo; in the regiment. Mulvaney had taught personal
      cleanliness and efficiency as the first articles of his companions&rsquo; creed.
      &lsquo;A dhirty man,&rsquo; he was used to say, in the speech of his kind, &lsquo;goes to
      Clink for a weakness in the knees, an&rsquo; is coort-martialled for a pair av
      socks missin&rsquo;; but a clane man, such as is an ornament to his service&mdash;a
      man whose buttons are gold, whose coat is wax upon him, an&rsquo; whose
      &lsquo;coutrements are widout a speck&mdash;THAT man may, spakin&rsquo; in reason, do
      fwhat he likes an&rsquo; dhrink from day to divil. That&rsquo;s the pride av bein&rsquo; 
      dacint.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat together, upon a day, in the shade of a ravine far from the
      barracks, where a watercourse used to run in rainy weather. Behind us was
      the scrub jungle, in which jackals, peacocks, the gray wolves of the
      North-Western Provinces, and occasionally a tiger estrayed from Central
      India, were supposed to dwell. In front lay the cantonment, glaring white
      under a glaring sun; and on either side ran the broad road that led to
      Delhi.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the scrub that suggested to my mind the wisdom of Mulvaney taking a
      day&rsquo;s leave and going upon a shooting-tour. The peacock is a holy bird
      throughout India, and he who slays one is in danger of being mobbed by the
      nearest villagers; but on the last occasion that Mulvaney had gone forth,
      he had contrived, without in the least offending local religious
      susceptibilities, to return with six beautiful peacock skins which he sold
      to profit. It seemed just possible then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But fwhat manner av use is ut to me goin&rsquo; out widout a dhrink? The
      ground&rsquo;s powdher-dhry underfoot, an&rsquo; ut gets unto the throat fit to kill,&rsquo; 
      wailed Mulvaney, looking at me reproachfully. &lsquo;An&rsquo; a peacock is not a bird
      you can catch the tail av onless ye run. Can a man run on wather&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      jungle-wather too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris had considered the question in all its bearings. He spoke,
      chewing his pipe-stem meditatively the while:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘Go forth, return in glory, To Clusium&rsquo;s royal &lsquo;ome:
 An&rsquo; round these bloomin&rsquo; temples &lsquo;ang
 The bloomin&rsquo; shields o&rsquo; Rome.
</pre>
    <p>
      You better go. You ain&rsquo;t like to shoot yourself&mdash;not while there&rsquo;s a
      chanst of liquor. Me an&rsquo; Learoyd&rsquo;ll stay at &lsquo;ome an&rsquo; keep shop&mdash;&lsquo;case
      o&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; turnin&rsquo; up. But you go out with a gas-pipe gun an&rsquo; ketch the
      little peacockses or somethin&rsquo;. You kin get one day&rsquo;s leave easy as
      winkin&rsquo;. Go along an&rsquo; get it, an&rsquo; get peacockses or somethin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jock,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, turning to Learoyd, who was half asleep under the
      shadow of the bank. He roused slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sitha, Mulvaaney, go,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mulvaney went; cursing his allies with Irish fluency and barrack-room
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take note,&rsquo; said he, when he had won his holiday, and appeared dressed in
      his roughest clothes with the only other regimental fowling-piece in his
      hand. &lsquo;Take note, Jock, an&rsquo; you Orth&rsquo;ris, I am goin&rsquo; in the face av my own
      will&mdash;all for to please you. I misdoubt anythin&rsquo; will come av
      permiscuous huntin&rsquo; afther peacockses in a desolit lan&rsquo;; an&rsquo; I know that I
      will lie down an&rsquo; die wid thirrrst. Me catch peacockses for you, ye lazy
      scutts&mdash;an&rsquo; be sacrificed by the peasanthry&mdash;Ugh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved a huge paw and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twilight, long before the appointed hour, he returned empty-handed,
      much begrimed with dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peacockses?&rsquo; queried Ortheris from the safe rest of a barrack-room table
      whereon he was smoking cross-legged, Learoyd fast asleep on a bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jock,&rsquo; said Mulvaney without answering, as he stirred up the sleeper.
      &lsquo;Jock, can ye fight? Will ye fight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly the meaning of the words communicated itself to the
      half-roused man. He understood&mdash;and again&mdash;what might these
      things mean? Mulvaney was shaking him savagely. Meantime the men in the
      room howled with delight. There was war in the confederacy at last&mdash;war
      and the breaking of bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrack-room etiquette is stringent. On the direct challenge must follow
      the direct reply. This is more binding than the ties of tried friendship.
      Once again Mulvaney repeated the question. Learoyd answered by the only
      means in his power, and so swiftly that the Irishman had barely time to
      avoid the blow. The laughter around increased. Learoyd looked bewilderedly
      at his friend&mdash;himself as greatly bewildered. Ortheris dropped from
      the table because his world was falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come outside,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, and as the occupants of the barrack-room
      prepared joyously to follow, he turned and said furiously, &lsquo;There will be
      no fight this night&mdash;onless any wan av you is wishful to assist. The
      man that does, follows on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No man moved. The three passed out into the moonlight, Learoyd fumbling
      with the buttons of his coat. The parade-ground was deserted except for
      the scurrying jackals. Mulvaney&rsquo;s impetuous rush carried his companions
      far into the open ere Learoyd attempted to turn round and continue the
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be still now. &lsquo;Twas my fault for beginnin&rsquo; things in the middle av an
      end, Jock. I should ha&rsquo; comminst wid an explanation; but Jock, dear, on
      your sowl are ye fit, think you, for the finest fight that iver was&mdash;betther
      than fightin&rsquo; me? Considher before ye answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      More than ever puzzled, Learoyd turned round two or three times, felt an
      arm, kicked tentatively, and answered, &lsquo;Ah&rsquo;m fit.&rsquo; He was accustomed to
      fight blindly at the bidding of the superior mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat them down, the men looking on from afar, and Mulvaney untangled
      himself in mighty words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Followin&rsquo; your fools&rsquo; scheme I wint out into the thrackless desert beyond
      the barricks. An&rsquo; there I met a pious Hindu dhriving a bullock-kyart. I
      tuk ut for granted he wud be delighted for to convoy me a piece, an&rsquo; I
      jumped in&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You long, lazy, black-haired swine,&rsquo; drawled Ortheris, who would have
      done the same thing under similar circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas the height av policy. That naygur-man dhruv miles an&rsquo; miles&mdash;as
      far as the new railway line they&rsquo;re buildin&rsquo; now back av the Tavi river.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a kyart for dhirt only,&rdquo; says he now an&rsquo; again timoreously, to get
      me out av ut. &ldquo;Dhirt I am,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the dhryest that you iver kyarted.
      Dhrive on, me son, an glory be wid you.&rdquo; At that I wint to slape, an&rsquo; took
      no heed till he pulled up on the embankmint av the line where the coolies
      were pilin&rsquo; mud. There was a matther av two thousand coolies on that line&mdash;you
      remimber that. Prisintly a bell rang, an&rsquo; they throops off to a big
      pay-shed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the white man in charge?&rdquo; sez I to my kyart-dhriver.
      &ldquo;In the shed,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;engaged on a riffle.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A fwhat?&rdquo; sez I.
      &ldquo;Riffle,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;You take ticket. He take money. You get nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s fwhat the shuperior an&rsquo; cultivated man calls a
      raffle, me misbeguided child av darkness an&rsquo; sin. Lead on to that raffle,
      though fwhat the mischief &lsquo;tis doin&rsquo; so far away from uts home&mdash;which
      is the charity-bazaar at Christmas, an&rsquo; the colonel&rsquo;s wife grinnin&rsquo; behind
      the tea-table&mdash;is more than I know.&rdquo; Wid that I wint to the shed an&rsquo; 
      found &lsquo;twas pay-day among the coolies. Their wages was on a table forninst
      a big, fine, red buck av a man&mdash;sivun fut high, four fut wide, an&rsquo; 
      three fut thick, wid a fist on him like a corn-sack. He was payin&rsquo; the
      coolies fair an&rsquo; easy, but he wud ask each man if he wud raffle that
      month, an&rsquo; each man sez? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; av course. Thin he wud deduct from their
      wages accordin&rsquo;. Whin all was paid, he filled an ould cigar-box full av
      gun-wads an&rsquo; scatthered ut among the coolies. They did not take much joy
      av that performince, an&rsquo; small wondher. A man close to me picks up a black
      gun-wad an&rsquo; sings out, &ldquo;I have ut.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Good may ut do you,&rdquo; sez I. The
      coolie wint forward to this big, fine, red man, who threw a cloth off av
      the most sumpshus, jooled, enamelled an&rsquo; variously bedivilled sedan-chair
      I iver saw.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sedan-chair! Put your &lsquo;ead in a bag. That was a palanquin. Don&rsquo;t yer know
      a palanquin when you see it?&rsquo; said Ortheris with great scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I chuse to call ut sedan-chair, an&rsquo; chair ut shall be, little man,&rsquo; 
      continued the Irishman. &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a most amazin&rsquo; chair&mdash;all lined wid
      pink silk an&rsquo; fitted wid red silk curtains. &ldquo;Here ut is,&rdquo; sez the red man.
      &ldquo;Here ut is,&rdquo; sez the coolie, an&rsquo; he grinned weakly-ways. &ldquo;Is ut any use
      to you?&rdquo; sez the red man. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; sez the coolie; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make a
      presint av ut to you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am graciously pleased to accept that
      same,&rdquo; sez the red man; an&rsquo; at that all the coolies cried aloud in fwhat
      was mint for cheerful notes, an&rsquo; wint back to their diggin&rsquo;, lavin&rsquo; me
      alone in the shed. The red man saw me, an&rsquo; his face grew blue on his big,
      fat neck. &ldquo;Fwhat d&rsquo;you want here?&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Standin&rsquo;-room an&rsquo; no more,&rdquo;
       sez I, &ldquo;onless it may be fwhat ye niver had, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s manners, ye
      rafflin&rsquo; ruffian,&rdquo; for I was not goin&rsquo; to have the Service throd upon.
      &ldquo;Out of this,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in charge av this section av construction.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      in charge av mesilf,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s like I will stay a while. D&rsquo;ye
      raffle much in these parts?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fwhat&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; sez he.
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;but a great dale to you, for begad I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; you get
      the full half av your revenue from that sedan-chair. Is ut always raffled
      so?&rdquo; I sez, an&rsquo; wid that I wint to a coolie to ask questions. Bhoys, that
      man&rsquo;s name is Dearsley, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been rafflin&rsquo; that ould sedan-chair
      monthly this matther av nine months. Ivry coolie on the section takes a
      ticket&mdash;or he gives &lsquo;em the go&mdash;wanst a month on pay-day. Ivry
      coolie that wins ut gives ut back to him, for &lsquo;tis too big to carry away,
      an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d sack the man that thried to sell ut. That Dearsley has been
      makin&rsquo; the rowlin&rsquo; wealth av Roshus by nefarious rafflin&rsquo;. Think av the
      burnin&rsquo; shame to the sufferin&rsquo; coolie-man that the army in Injia are bound
      to protect an&rsquo; nourish in their bosoms! Two thousand coolies defrauded
      wanst a month!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dom t&rsquo; coolies. Has&rsquo;t gotten t&rsquo; cheer, man?&rsquo; said Learoyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hould on. Havin&rsquo; onearthed this amazin&rsquo; an&rsquo; stupenjus fraud committed by
      the man Dearsley, I hild a council av war; he thryin&rsquo; all the time to
      sejuce me into a fight with opprobrious language. That sedan-chair niver
      belonged by right to any foreman av coolies. &lsquo;Tis a king&rsquo;s chair or a
      quane&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s gold on ut an&rsquo; silk an&rsquo; all manner av trapesemints.
      Bhoys, &lsquo;tis not for me to countenance any sort av wrong-doin&rsquo;&mdash;me
      bein&rsquo; the ould man&mdash;but&mdash;anyway he has had ut nine months, an&rsquo; 
      he dare not make throuble av ut was taken from him. Five miles away, or ut
      may be six&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, and the jackals howled merrily. Learoyd bared one
      arm, and contemplated it in the moonlight. Then he nodded partly to
      himself and partly to his friends. Ortheris wriggled with suppressed
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought ye wud see the reasonableness av ut,&rsquo; said Mulvaney. &lsquo;I made
      bould to say as much to the man before. He was for a direct front attack&mdash;fut,
      horse, an&rsquo; guns&mdash;an&rsquo; all for nothin&rsquo;, seein&rsquo; that I had no thransport
      to convey the machine away. &ldquo;I will not argue wid you,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;this day,
      but subsequently, Mister Dearsley, me rafflin&rsquo; jool, we talk ut out
      lengthways. &lsquo;Tis no good policy to swindle the naygur av his hard-earned
      emolumints, an&rsquo; by presint informashin&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&lsquo;twas the kyart man that
      tould me&mdash;&ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve been perpethrating that same for nine months. But
      I&rsquo;m a just man,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo; overlookin&rsquo; the presumpshin that yondher
      settee wid the gilt top was not come by honust&rdquo;&mdash;at that he turned
      sky-green, so I knew things was more thrue than tellable&mdash;&ldquo;not come
      by honust, I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to compound the felony for this month&rsquo;s winnin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Ho!&rsquo; from Learoyd and Ortheris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man Dearsley&rsquo;s rushin&rsquo; on his fate,&rsquo; continued Mulvaney, solemnly
      wagging his head. &lsquo;All Hell had no name bad enough for me that tide.
      Faith, he called me a robber! Me! that was savin&rsquo; him from continuin&rsquo; in
      his evil ways widout a remonstrince&mdash;an&rsquo; to a man av conscience a
      remonstrince may change the chune av his life. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not for me to argue,&rdquo;
       sez I, &ldquo;fwhatever ye are, Mister Dearsley, but, by my hand, I&rsquo;ll take away
      the temptation for you that lies in that sedan-chair.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You will
      have to fight me for ut,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;for well I know you will never dare
      make report to any one.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fight I will,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;but not this day,
      for I&rsquo;m rejuced for want av nourishment.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re an ould bould
      hand,&rdquo; sez he, sizin&rsquo; me up an&rsquo; down; &ldquo;an&rsquo; a jool av a fight we will have.
      Eat now an&rsquo; dhrink, an&rsquo; go your way.&rdquo; Wid that he gave me some hump an&rsquo; 
      whisky&mdash;good whisky&mdash;an&rsquo; we talked av this an&rsquo; that the while.
      &ldquo;It goes hard on me now,&rdquo; sez I, wipin&rsquo; my mouth, &ldquo;to confiscate that
      piece av furniture, but justice is justice.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve not got ut yet,&rdquo;
       sez he; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the fight between.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a good
      fight. Ye shall have the pick av the best quality in my rigimint for the
      dinner you have given this day.&rdquo; Thin I came hot-foot to you two. Hould
      your tongue, the both. &lsquo;Tis this way. To-morrow we three will go there an&rsquo; 
      he shall have his pick betune me an&rsquo; Jock. Jock&rsquo;s a deceivin&rsquo; fighter, for
      he is all fat to the eye, an&rsquo; he moves slow. Now, I&rsquo;m all beef to the
      look, an&rsquo; I move quick. By my reckonin&rsquo; the Dearsley man won&rsquo;t take me; so
      me an&rsquo; Orth&rsquo;ris &lsquo;ll see fair play. Jock, I tell you, &rsquo;twill be big fightin&rsquo;&mdash;whipped,
      wid the cream above the jam. Afther the business &lsquo;twill take a good three
      av us&mdash;Jock &lsquo;ll be very hurt&mdash;to haul away that sedan-chair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Palanquin.&rsquo; This from Ortheris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fwhatever ut is, we must have ut. &lsquo;Tis the only sellin&rsquo; piece av property
      widin reach that we can get so cheap. An&rsquo; fwhat&rsquo;s a fight afther all? He
      has robbed the naygur-man, dishonust. We rob him honust for the sake av
      the whisky he gave me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wot&rsquo;ll we do with the bloomin&rsquo; article when we&rsquo;ve got it? Them
      palanquins are as big as &lsquo;ouses, an&rsquo; uncommon &lsquo;ard to sell, as McCleary
      said when ye stole the sentry-box from the Curragh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do t&rsquo; fightin&rsquo;?&rsquo; said Learoyd, and Ortheris subsided. The
      three returned to barracks without a word. Mulvaney&rsquo;s last argument
      clinched the matter. This palanquin was property, vendible, and to be
      attained in the simplest and least embarrassing fashion. It would
      eventually become beer. Great was Mulvaney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next afternoon a procession of three formed itself and disappeared into
      the scrub in the direction of the new railway line. Learoyd alone was
      without care, for Mulvaney dived darkly into the future, and little
      Ortheris feared the unknown. What befell at that interview in the lonely
      pay-shed by the side of the half-built embankment, only a few hundred
      coolies know, and their tale is confusing one, running thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were at work. Three men in red coats came. They saw the Sahib&mdash;Dearsley
      Sahib. They made oration; and noticeably the small man among the
      red-coats. Dearsley Sahib also made oration, and used many very strong
      words. Upon this talk they departed together to an open space, and there
      the fat man in the red coat fought with Dearsley Sahib after the custom of
      white men&mdash;with his hands, making no noise, and never at all pulling
      Dearsley Sahib&rsquo;s hair. Such of us as were not afraid beheld these things
      for just so long a time as a man needs to cook the mid-day meal. The small
      man in the red coat had possessed himself of Dearsley Sahib&rsquo;s watch. No,
      he did not steal that watch. He held it in his hand, and at certain
      seasons made outcry, and the twain ceased their combat, which was like the
      combat of young bulls in spring. Both men were soon all red, but Dearsley
      Sahib was much more red than the other. Seeing this, and fearing for his
      life&mdash;because we greatly loved him&mdash;some fifty of us made shift
      to rush upon the red-coats. But a certain man&mdash;very black as to the
      hair, and in no way to be confused with the small man, or the fat man who
      fought&mdash;that man, we affirm, ran upon us, and of us he embraced some
      ten or fifty in both arms, and beat our heads together, so that our livers
      turned to water, and we ran away. It is not good to interfere in the
      fightings of white men. After that Dearsley Sahib fell and did not rise,
      these men jumped upon his stomach and despoiled him of all his money, and
      attempted to fire the pay-shed, and departed. Is it true that Dearsley
      Sahib makes no complaint of these latter things having been done? We were
      senseless with fear, and do not at all remember. There was no palanquin
      near the pay-shed. What do we know about palanquins? Is it true that
      Dearsley Sahib does not return to this place, on account of his sickness,
      for ten days? This is the fault of those bad men in the red coats, who
      should be severely punished; for Dearsley Sahib is both our father and
      mother, and we love him much. Yet, if Dearsley Sahib does not return to
      this place at all, we will speak the truth. There was a palanquin, for the
      up-keep of which we were forced to pay nine-tenths of our monthly wage. On
      such mulctings Dearsley Sahib allowed us to make obeisance to him before
      the palanquin. What could we do? We were poor men. He took a full half of
      our wages. Will the Government repay us those moneys? Those three men in
      red coats bore the palanquin upon their shoulders and departed. All the
      money that Dearsley Sahib had taken from us was in the cushions of that
      palanquin. Therefore they stole it. Thousands of rupees were there&mdash;all
      our money. It was our bank-box, to fill which we cheerfully contributed to
      Dearsley Sahib three-sevenths of our monthly wage. Why does the white man
      look upon us with the eye of disfavour? Before God, there was a palanquin,
      and now there is no palanquin; and if they send the police here to make
      inquisition, we can only say that there never has been any palanquin. Why
      should a palanquin be near these works? We are poor men, and we know
      nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the simplest version of the simplest story connected with the
      descent upon Dearsley. From the lips of the coolies I received it.
      Dearsley himself was in no condition to say anything, and Mulvaney
      preserved a massive silence, broken only by the occasional licking of the
      lips. He had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech was
      taken from him. I respected that reserve until, three days after the
      affair, I discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of
      unchastened splendour&mdash;evidently in past days the litter of a queen.
      The pole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich
      with the painted papier-mache of Cashmere. The shoulder-pads were of
      yellow silk. The panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of
      all the gods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon&mdash;lacquer on cedar.
      The cedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent Jaipur
      enamel and ran in grooves shod with silver. The cushions were of brocaded
      Delhi silk, and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of
      the king&rsquo;s palace were stiff with gold. Closer investigation showed that
      the entire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discoloured by time and wear;
      but even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the
      threshold of a royal zenana. I found no fault with it, except that it was
      in my stable. Then, trying to lift it by the silver-shod shoulder-pole, I
      laughed. The road from Dearsley&rsquo;s pay-shed to the cantonment was a narrow
      and uneven one, and, traversed by three very inexperienced
      palanquin-bearers, one of whom was sorely battered about the head, must
      have been a path of torment. Still I did not quite recognise the right of
      the three musketeers to turn me into a &lsquo;fence&rsquo; for stolen property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you to warehouse ut,&rsquo; said Mulvaney when he was brought to
      consider the question. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no steal in ut. Dearsley tould us we cud
      have ut if we fought. Jock fought&mdash;an&rsquo;, oh, sorr, when the throuble
      was at uts finest an&rsquo; Jock was bleedin&rsquo; like a stuck pig, an&rsquo; little
      Orth&rsquo;ris was shquealin&rsquo; on one leg chewin&rsquo; big bites out av Dearsley&rsquo;s
      watch, I wud ha&rsquo; given my place at the fight to have had you see wan
      round. He tuk Jock, as I suspicioned he would, an&rsquo; Jock was deceptive.
      Nine roun&rsquo;s they were even matched, an&rsquo; at the tenth&mdash;About that
      palanquin now. There&rsquo;s not the least throuble in the world, or we wud not
      ha&rsquo; brought ut here. You will ondherstand that the Queen&mdash;God bless
      her!&mdash;does not reckon for a privit soldier to kape elephints an&rsquo; 
      palanquins an&rsquo; sich in barricks. Afther we had dhragged ut down from
      Dearsley&rsquo;s through that cruel scrub that near broke Orth&rsquo;ris&rsquo;s heart, we
      set ut in the ravine for a night; an&rsquo; a thief av a porcupine an&rsquo; a
      civet-cat av a jackal roosted in ut, as well we knew in the mornin&rsquo;. I put
      ut to you, sorr, is an elegint palanquin, fit for the princess, the
      natural abidin&rsquo; place av all the vermin in cantonmints? We brought ut to
      you, afther dhark, and put ut in your shtable. Do not let your conscience
      prick. Think av the rejoicin&rsquo; men in the pay-shed yonder&mdash;lookin&rsquo; at
      Dearsley wid his head tied up in a towel&mdash;an&rsquo; well knowin&rsquo; that they
      can dhraw their pay ivry month widout stoppages for riffles. Indirectly,
      sorr, you have rescued from an onprincipled son av a night-hawk the
      peasanthry av a numerous village. An&rsquo; besides, will I let that sedan-chair
      rot on our hands? Not I. &lsquo;Tis not every day a piece av pure joolry comes
      into the market. There&rsquo;s not a king widin these forty miles&rsquo;&mdash;he
      waved his hand round the dusty horizon&mdash;&lsquo;not a king wud not be glad
      to buy ut. Some day meself, whin I have leisure, I&rsquo;ll take ut up along the
      road an&rsquo; dishpose av ut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; said I, for I knew the man was capable of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get into ut, av coorse, and keep wan eye open through the curtains. Whin
      I see a likely man av the native persuasion, I will descind blushin&rsquo; from
      my canopy and say, &ldquo;Buy a palanquin, ye black scutt?&rdquo; I will have to hire
      four men to carry me first, though; and that&rsquo;s impossible till next
      pay-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, Learoyd, who had fought for the prize, and in the
      winning secured the highest pleasure life had to offer him, was altogether
      disposed to undervalue it, while Ortheris openly said it would be better
      to break the thing up. Dearsley, he argued, might be a many-sided man,
      capable, despite his magnificent fighting qualities, of setting in motion
      the machinery of the civil law&mdash;a thing much abhorred by the soldier.
      Under any circumstances their fun had come and passed; the next pay-day
      was close at hand, when there would be beer for all. Wherefore longer
      conserve the painted palanquin?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A first-class rifle-shot an&rsquo; a good little man av your inches you are,&rsquo; 
      said Mulvaney. &lsquo;But you niver had a head worth a soft-boiled egg. &lsquo;Tis me
      has to lie awake av nights schamin&rsquo; an&rsquo; plottin&rsquo; for the three av us.
      Orth&rsquo;ris, me son, &lsquo;tis no matther av a few gallons av beer&mdash;no, nor
      twenty gallons&mdash;but tubs an&rsquo; vats an&rsquo; firkins in that sedan-chair.
      Who ut was, an&rsquo; what ut was, an&rsquo; how ut got there, we do not know; but I
      know in my bones that you an&rsquo; me an&rsquo; Jock wid his sprained thumb will get
      a fortune thereby. Lave me alone, an&rsquo; let me think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the palanquin stayed in my stall, the key of which was in
      Mulvaney&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pay-day came, and with it beer. It was not in experience to hope that
      Mulvaney, dried by four weeks&rsquo; drought, would avoid excess. Next morning
      he and the palanquin had disappeared. He had taken the precaution of
      getting three days&rsquo; leave &lsquo;to see a friend on the railway,&rsquo; and the
      colonel, well knowing that the seasonal outburst was near, and hoping it
      would spend its force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction, cheerfully
      gave him all he demanded. At this point Mulvaney&rsquo;s history, as recorded in
      the mess-room, stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris carried it not much further. &lsquo;No, &lsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t drunk,&rsquo; said the
      little man loyally, &lsquo;the liquor was no more than feelin&rsquo; its way round
      inside of &lsquo;im; but &lsquo;e went an&rsquo; filled that &lsquo;ole bloomin&rsquo; palanquin with
      bottles &lsquo;fore &lsquo;e went off. &lsquo;E&rsquo;s gone an&rsquo; &lsquo;ired six men to carry &lsquo;im, an&rsquo; I
      &lsquo;ad to &lsquo;elp &lsquo;im into &lsquo;is nupshal couch, &lsquo;cause &lsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;ear reason.
      &lsquo;E&rsquo;s gone off in &lsquo;is shirt an&rsquo; trousies, swearin&rsquo; tremenjus&mdash;gone
      down the road in the palanquin, wavin&rsquo; &lsquo;is legs out o&rsquo; windy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you arx me a question. &lsquo;E said &lsquo;e was goin&rsquo; to sell that palanquin,
      but from observations what happened when I was stuffin&rsquo; &lsquo;im through the
      door, I fancy &lsquo;e&rsquo;s gone to the new embankment to mock at Dearsley. &lsquo;Soon
      as Jock&rsquo;s off duty I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; there to see if &lsquo;e&rsquo;s safe&mdash;not Mulvaney,
      but t&rsquo;other man. My saints, but I pity &lsquo;im as &lsquo;elps Terence out o&rsquo; the
      palanquin when &lsquo;e&rsquo;s once fair drunk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come back without harm,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Corse &lsquo;e will. On&rsquo;y question is, what &lsquo;ll &lsquo;e be doin&rsquo; on the road?
      Killing Dearsley, like as not. &lsquo;E shouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a gone without Jock or me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Reinforced by Learoyd, Ortheris sought the foreman of the coolie-gang.
      Dearsley&rsquo;s head was still embellished with towels. Mulvaney, drunk or
      sober, would have struck no man in that condition, and Dearsley
      indignantly denied that he would have taken advantage of the intoxicated
      brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had my pick o&rsquo; you two,&rsquo; he explained to Learoyd, &lsquo;and you got my
      palanquin&mdash;not before I&rsquo;d made my profit on it. Why&rsquo;d I do harm when
      everything&rsquo;s settled? Your man DID come here&mdash;drunk as Davy&rsquo;s sow on
      a frosty night&mdash;came a-purpose to mock me&mdash;stuck his head out of
      the door an&rsquo; called me a crucified hodman. I made him drunker, an&rsquo; sent
      him along. But I never touched him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To these things, Learoyd, slow to perceive the evidences of sincerity,
      answered only, &lsquo;If owt comes to Mulvaaney &lsquo;long o&rsquo; you, I&rsquo;ll gripple you,
      clouts or no clouts on your ugly head, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll draw t&rsquo; throat twistyways,
      man. See there now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The embassy removed itself, and Dearsley, the battered, laughed alone over
      his supper that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days passed&mdash;a fourth and a fifth. The week drew to a close and
      Mulvaney did not return. He, his royal palanquin, and his six attendants,
      had vanished into air. A very large and very tipsy soldier, his feet
      sticking out of the litter of a reigning princess, is not a thing to
      travel along the ways without comment. Yet no man of all the country round
      had seen any such wonder. He was, and he was not; and Learoyd suggested
      the immediate smashment of Dearsley as a sacrifice to his ghost. Ortheris
      insisted that all was well, and in the light of past experience his hopes
      seemed reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When Mulvaney goes up the road,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;&rsquo;e&rsquo;s like to go a very long
      ways up, specially when &lsquo;e&rsquo;s so blue drunk as &lsquo;e is now. But what gits me
      is &lsquo;is not bein&rsquo; &lsquo;eard of pullin&rsquo; wool off the niggers somewheres about.
      That don&rsquo;t look good. The drink must ha&rsquo; died out in &lsquo;im by this, unless
      &lsquo;e&rsquo;s broke a bank, an&rsquo; then&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t &lsquo;e come back? &lsquo;E didn&rsquo;t ought
      to ha&rsquo; gone off without us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Ortheris&rsquo;s heart sank at the end of the seventh day, for half the
      regiment were out scouring the country-side, and Learoyd had been forced
      to fight two men who hinted openly that Mulvaney had deserted. To do him
      justice, the colonel laughed at the notion, even when it was put forward
      by his much-trusted adjutant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mulvaney would as soon think of deserting as you would,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;No;
      he&rsquo;s either fallen into a mischief among the villagers&mdash;and yet that
      isn&rsquo;t likely, for he&rsquo;d blarney himself out of the Pit; or else he is
      engaged on urgent private affairs&mdash;some stupendous devilment that we
      shall hear of at mess after it has been the round of the barrack-rooms.
      The worst of it is that I shall have to give him twenty-eight days&rsquo; 
      confinement at least for being absent without leave, just when I most want
      him to lick the new batch of recruits into shape. I never knew a man who
      could put a polish on young soldiers as quickly as Mulvaney can. How does
      he do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With blarney and the buckle-end of a belt, sir,&rsquo; said the adjutant. &lsquo;He
      is worth a couple of non-commissioned officers when we are dealing with an
      Irish draft, and the London lads seem to adore him. The worst of it is
      that if he goes to the cells the other two are neither to hold nor to bind
      till he comes out again. I believe Ortheris preaches mutiny on those
      occasions, and I know that the mere presence of Learoyd mourning for
      Mulvaney kills all the cheerfulness of his room. The sergeants tell me
      that he allows no man to laugh when he feels unhappy. They are a queer
      gang.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For all that, I wish we had a few more of them. I like a well-conducted
      regiment, but these pasty-faced, shifty-eyed, mealy-mouthed young
      slouchers from the depot worry me sometimes with their offensive virtue.
      They don&rsquo;t seem to have backbone enough to do anything but play cards and
      prowl round the married quarters. I believe I&rsquo;d forgive that old villain
      on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that I could in
      decency accept.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not likely to be much difficulty about that, sir,&rsquo; said the adjutant.
      &lsquo;Mulvaney&rsquo;s explanations are only one degree less wonderful than his
      performances. They say that when he was in the Black Tyrone, before he
      came to us, he was discovered on the banks of the Liffey trying to sell
      his colonel&rsquo;s charger to a Donegal dealer as a perfect lady&rsquo;s hack.
      Shackbolt commanded the Tyrone then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shackbolt must have had apoplexy at the thought of his ramping war-horses
      answering to that description. He used to buy unbacked devils, and tame
      them on some pet theory of starvation. What did Mulvaney say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he was a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
      Animals, anxious to &ldquo;sell the poor baste where he would get something to
      fill out his dimples.&rdquo; Shackbolt laughed, but I fancy that was why
      Mulvaney exchanged to ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he were back,&rsquo; said the colonel; &lsquo;for I like him and believe he
      likes me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, to cheer our souls, Learoyd, Ortheris, and I went into the
      waste to smoke out a porcupine. All the dogs attended, but even their
      clamour&mdash;and they began to discuss the shortcomings of porcupines
      before they left cantonments&mdash;could not take us out of ourselves. A
      large, low moon turned the tops of the plume-grass to silver, and the
      stunted camelthorn bushes and sour tamarisks into the likenesses of
      trooping devils. The smell of the sun had not left the earth, and little
      aimless winds blowing across the rose-gardens to the southward brought the
      scent of dried roses and water. Our fire once started, and the dogs
      craftily disposed to wait the dash of the porcupine, we climbed to the top
      of a rain-scarred hillock of earth, and looked across the scrub seamed
      with cattle paths, white with the long grass, and dotted with spots of
      level pond-bottom, where the snipe would gather in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Ortheris, with a sigh, as he took in the unkempt desolation
      of it all, &lsquo;this is sanguinary. This is unusually sanguinary. Sort o&rsquo; mad
      country. Like a grate when the fire&rsquo;s put out by the sun.&rsquo; He shaded his
      eyes against the moonlight. &lsquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a loony dancin&rsquo; in the middle of
      it all. Quite right. I&rsquo;d dance too if I wasn&rsquo;t so downheart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There pranced a Portent in the face of the moon&mdash;a huge and ragged
      spirit of the waste, that flapped its wings from afar. It had risen out of
      the earth; it was coming towards us, and its outline was never twice the
      same. The toga, table-cloth, or dressing-gown, whatever the creature wore,
      took a hundred shapes. Once it stopped on a neighbouring mound and flung
      all its legs and arms to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My, but that scarecrow &lsquo;as got &lsquo;em bad!&rsquo; said Ortheris. &lsquo;Seems like if &lsquo;e
      comes any furder we&rsquo;ll &lsquo;ave to argify with &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Learoyd raised himself from the dirt as a bull clears his flanks of the
      wallow. And as a bull bellows, so he, after a short minute at gaze, gave
      tongue to the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MULVAANEY! MULVAANEY! A-hoo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh then it was that we yelled, and the figure dipped into the hollow,
      till, with a crash of rending grass, the lost one strode up to the light
      of the fire and disappeared to the waist in a wave of joyous dogs! Then
      Learoyd and Ortheris gave greeting, bass and falsetto together, both
      swallowing a lump in the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You damned fool!&rsquo; said they, and severally pounded him with their fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go easy!&rsquo; he answered; wrapping a huge arm round each. &lsquo;I would have you
      to know that I am a god, to be treated as such&mdash;tho&rsquo;, by my faith, I
      fancy I&rsquo;ve got to go to the guard-room just like a privit soldier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the sentence destroyed the suspicions raised by the
      former. Any one would have been justified in regarding Mulvaney as mad. He
      was hatless and shoeless, and his shirt and trousers were dropping off
      him. But he wore one wondrous garment&mdash;a gigantic cloak that fell
      from collar-bone to heel&mdash;of pale pink silk, wrought all over in
      cunningest needlework of hands long since dead, with the loves of the
      Hindu gods. The monstrous figures leaped in and out of the light of the
      fire as he settled the folds round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris handled the stuff respectfully for a moment while I was trying to
      remember where I had seen it before. Then he screamed, &lsquo;What &lsquo;AVE you done
      with the palanquin? You&rsquo;re wearin&rsquo; the linin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said the Irishman, &lsquo;an&rsquo; by the same token the &lsquo;broidery is
      scrapin&rsquo; my hide off. I&rsquo;ve lived in this sumpshus counterpane for four
      days. Me son, I begin to ondherstand why the naygur is no use. Widout me
      boots, an&rsquo; me trousies like an openwork stocking on a gyurl&rsquo;s leg at a
      dance, I begin to feel like a naygur-man&mdash;all fearful an&rsquo; timoreous.
      Give me a pipe an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a pipe, resumed his grip of his two friends, and rocked to and fro
      in a gale of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mulvaney,&rsquo; said Ortheris sternly, &lsquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no time for laughin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ve
      given Jock an&rsquo; me more trouble than you&rsquo;re worth. You &lsquo;ave been absent
      without leave an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll go into cells for that; an&rsquo; you &lsquo;ave come back
      disgustin&rsquo;ly dressed an&rsquo; most improper in the linin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that bloomin&rsquo; 
      palanquin. Instid of which you laugh. An&rsquo; WE thought you was dead all the
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bhoys,&rsquo; said the culprit, still shaking gently, &lsquo;whin I&rsquo;ve done my tale
      you may cry if you like, an&rsquo; little Orth&rsquo;ris here can thrample my inside
      out. Ha&rsquo; done an&rsquo; listen. My performances have been stupenjus: my luck has
      been the blessed luck av the British Army&mdash;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no betther
      than that. I went out dhrunk an&rsquo; dhrinkin&rsquo; in the palanquin, and I have
      come back a pink god. Did any of you go to Dearsley afther my time was up?
      He was at the bottom of ut all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah said so,&rsquo; murmured Learoyd. &lsquo;To-morrow ah&rsquo;ll smash t&rsquo; face in upon his
      heead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye will not. Dearsley&rsquo;s a jool av a man. Afther Ortheris had put me into
      the palanquin an&rsquo; the six bearer-men were gruntin&rsquo; down the road, I tuk
      thought to mock Dearsley for that fight. So I tould thim, &ldquo;Go to the
      embankmint,&rdquo; and there, bein&rsquo; most amazin&rsquo; full, I shtuck my head out av
      the concern an&rsquo; passed compliments wid Dearsley. I must ha&rsquo; miscalled him
      outrageous, for whin I am that way the power av the tongue comes on me. I
      can bare remimber tellin&rsquo; him that his mouth opened endways like the mouth
      av a skate, which was thrue afther Learoyd had handled ut; an&rsquo; I clear
      remimber his takin&rsquo; no manner nor matter av offence, but givin&rsquo; me a big
      dhrink of beer. &lsquo;Twas the beer did the thrick, for I crawled back into the
      palanquin, steppin&rsquo; on me right ear wid me left foot, an&rsquo; thin I slept
      like the dead. Wanst I half-roused, an&rsquo; begad the noise in my head was
      tremenjus&mdash;roarin&rsquo; and rattlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; poundin&rsquo; such as was quite new to
      me. &ldquo;Mother av Mercy,&rdquo; thinks I, &ldquo;phwat a concertina I will have on my
      shoulders whin I wake!&rdquo; An&rsquo; wid that I curls mysilf up to sleep before ut
      should get hould on me. Bhoys, that noise was not dhrink, &lsquo;twas the rattle
      av a thrain!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed an impressive pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he had put me on a thrain&mdash;put me, palanquin an&rsquo; all, an&rsquo; six
      black assassins av his own coolies that was in his nefarious confidence,
      on the flat av a ballast-thruck, and we were rowlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; bowlin&rsquo; along to
      Benares. Glory be that I did not wake up thin an&rsquo; introjuce mysilf to the
      coolies. As I was sayin&rsquo;, I slept for the betther part av a day an&rsquo; a
      night. But remimber you, that that man Dearsley had packed me off on wan
      av his material-thrains to Benares, all for to make me overstay my leave
      an&rsquo; get me into the cells.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation was an eminently rational one. Benares lay at least ten
      hours by rail from the cantonments, and nothing in the world could have
      saved Mulvaney from arrest as a deserter had he appeared there in the
      apparel of his orgies. Dearsley had not forgotten to take revenge.
      Learoyd, drawing back a little, began to place soft blows over selected
      portions of Mulvaney&rsquo;s body. His thoughts were away on the embankment, and
      they meditated evil for Dearsley. Mulvaney continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whin I was full awake the palanquin was set down in a street, I
      suspicioned, for I cud hear people passin&rsquo; an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo;. But I knew well I
      was far from home. There is a queer smell upon our cantonments&mdash;a
      smell av dried earth and brick-kilns wid whiffs av cavalry stable-litter.
      This place smelt marigold flowers an&rsquo; bad water, an&rsquo; wanst somethin&rsquo; alive
      came an&rsquo; blew heavy with his muzzle at the chink av the shutter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in
      a village I am,&rdquo; thinks I to mysilf, &ldquo;an&rsquo; the parochial buffalo is
      investigatin&rsquo; the palanquin.&rdquo; But anyways I had no desire to move. Only
      lie still whin you&rsquo;re in foreign parts an&rsquo; the standin&rsquo; luck av the
      British Army will carry ye through. That is an epigram. I made ut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thin a lot av whishperin&rsquo; divils surrounded the palanquin. &ldquo;Take ut up,&rdquo;
       sez wan man. &ldquo;But who&rsquo;ll pay us?&rdquo; sez another. &ldquo;The Maharanee&rsquo;s minister,
      av coorse,&rdquo; sez the man. &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; sez I to mysilf, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a quane in me own
      right, wid a minister to pay me expenses. I&rsquo;ll be an emperor if I lie
      still long enough; but this is no village I&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo; I lay quiet, but I
      gummed me right eye to a crack av the shutters, an&rsquo; I saw that the whole
      street was crammed wid palanquins an&rsquo; horses, an&rsquo; a sprinklin&rsquo; av naked
      priests all yellow powder an&rsquo; tigers&rsquo; tails. But I may tell you, Orth&rsquo;ris,
      an&rsquo; you, Learoyd, that av all the palanquins ours was the most imperial
      an&rsquo; magnificent. Now a palanquin means a native lady all the world over,
      except whin a soldier av the Quane happens to be takin&rsquo; a ride. &ldquo;Women an&rsquo; 
      priests!&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s son is in the right pew this time,
      Terence. There will be proceedin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Six black divils in pink muslin tuk
      up the palanquin, an&rsquo; oh! but the rowlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the rockin&rsquo; made me sick.
      Thin we got fair jammed among the palanquins&mdash;not more than fifty av
      them&mdash;an&rsquo; we grated an&rsquo; bumped like Queenstown potato-smacks in a
      runnin&rsquo; tide. I cud hear the women gigglin&rsquo; and squirkin&rsquo; in their
      palanquins, but mine was the royal equipage. They made way for ut, an&rsquo;,
      begad, the pink muslin men o&rsquo; mine were howlin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Room for the Maharanee
      av Gokral-Seetarun.&rdquo; Do you know aught av the lady, sorr?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;She is a very estimable old queen of the Central Indian
      States, and they say she is fat. How on earth could she go to Benares
      without all the city knowing her palanquin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas the eternal foolishness av the naygur-man. They saw the palanquin
      lying loneful an&rsquo; forlornsome, an&rsquo; the beauty av ut, after Dearsley&rsquo;s men
      had dhropped ut and gone away, an&rsquo; they gave ut the best name that
      occurred to thim. Quite right too. For aught we know the ould lady was
      thravellin&rsquo; incog&mdash;like me. I&rsquo;m glad to hear she&rsquo;s fat. I was no
      light weight mysilf, an&rsquo; my men were mortial anxious to dhrop me under a
      great big archway promiscuously ornamented wid the most improper carvin&rsquo;s
      an&rsquo; cuttin&rsquo;s I iver saw. Begad! they made me blush&mdash;like a&mdash;like
      a Maharanee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The temple of Prithi-Devi,&rsquo; I murmured, remembering the monstrous horrors
      of that sculptured archway at Benares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty Devilskins, savin&rsquo; your presence, sorr! There was nothin&rsquo; pretty
      about ut, except me. &lsquo;Twas all half dhark, an&rsquo; whin the coolies left they
      shut a big black gate behind av us, an&rsquo; half a company av fat yellow
      priests began pully-haulin&rsquo; the palanquins into a dharker place yet&mdash;a
      big stone hall full av pillars, an&rsquo; gods, an&rsquo; incense, an&rsquo; all manner av
      similar thruck. The gate disconcerted me, for I perceived I wud have to go
      forward to get out, my retreat bein&rsquo; cut off. By the same token a good
      priest makes a bad palanquin-coolie. Begad! they nearly turned me inside
      out draggin&rsquo; the palanquin to the temple. Now the disposishin av the
      forces inside was this way. The Maharanee av Gokral-Seetarun&mdash;that
      was me&mdash;lay by the favour av Providence on the far left flank behind
      the dhark av a pillar carved with elephints&rsquo; heads. The remainder av the
      palanquins was in a big half circle facing in to the biggest, fattest, an&rsquo; 
      most amazin&rsquo; she-god that iver I dreamed av. Her head ran up into the
      black above us, an&rsquo; her feet stuck out in the light av a little fire av
      melted butter that a priest was feedin&rsquo; out av a butter-dish. Thin a man
      began to sing an&rsquo; play on somethin&rsquo; back in the dhark, an &lsquo;twas a queer
      song. Ut made my hair lift on the back av my neck. Thin the doors av all
      the palanquins slid back, an&rsquo; the women bundled out. I saw what I&rsquo;ll niver
      see again. &lsquo;Twas more glorious than thransformations at a pantomime, for
      they was in pink an&rsquo; blue an&rsquo; silver an&rsquo; red an&rsquo; grass green, wid di&rsquo;monds
      an&rsquo; im&rsquo;ralds an&rsquo; great red rubies all over thim. But that was the least
      part av the glory. O bhoys, they were more lovely than the like av any
      loveliness in hiven; ay, their little bare feet were betther than the
      white hands av a lord&rsquo;s lady, an&rsquo; their mouths were like puckered roses,
      an&rsquo; their eyes were bigger an&rsquo; dharker than the eyes av any livin&rsquo; women
      I&rsquo;ve seen. Ye may laugh, but I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; truth. I niver saw the like, an&rsquo; 
      niver I will again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seeing that in all probability you were watching the wives and daughters
      of most of the Kings of India, the chances are that you won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I said,
      for it was dawning on me that Mulvaney had stumbled upon a big Queens&rsquo; 
      Praying at Benares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I niver will,&rsquo; he said mournfully. &lsquo;That sight doesn&rsquo;t come twist to any
      man. It made me ashamed to watch. A fat priest knocked at my door. I
      didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d have the insolince to disturb the Maharanee av
      Gokral-Seetarun, so I lay still. &ldquo;The old cow&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; sez he to
      another. &ldquo;Let her be,&rdquo; sez that. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill be long before she has a calf!&rdquo; I
      might ha&rsquo; known before he spoke that all a woman prays for in Injia&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      for matter o&rsquo; that in England too&mdash;is childher. That made me more
      sorry I&rsquo;d come, me bein&rsquo;, as you well know, a childless man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, thinking of his little son, dead many years
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They prayed, an&rsquo; the butter-fires blazed up an&rsquo; the incense turned
      everything blue, an&rsquo; between that an&rsquo; the fires the women looked as tho&rsquo; 
      they were all ablaze an&rsquo; twinklin&rsquo;. They took hold av the she-god&rsquo;s knees,
      they cried out an&rsquo; they threw themselves about, an&rsquo; that
      world-without-end-amen music was dhrivin&rsquo; thim mad. Mother av Hiven! how
      they cried, an&rsquo; the ould she-god grinnin&rsquo; above thim all so scornful! The
      dhrink was dyin&rsquo; out in me fast, an&rsquo; I was thinkin&rsquo; harder than the
      thoughts wud go through my head&mdash;thinkin&rsquo; how to get out, an&rsquo; all
      manner of nonsense as well. The women were rockin&rsquo; in rows, their di&rsquo;mond
      belts clickin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the tears runnin&rsquo; out betune their hands, an&rsquo; the
      lights were goin&rsquo; lower an&rsquo; dharker. Thin there was a blaze like lightnin&rsquo; 
      from the roof, an&rsquo; that showed me the inside av the palanquin, an&rsquo; at the
      end where my foot was, stood the livin&rsquo; spit an&rsquo; image o&rsquo; mysilf worked on
      the linin&rsquo;. This man here, ut was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hunted in the folds of his pink cloak, ran a hand under one, and thrust
      into the firelight a foot-long embroidered presentment of the great god
      Krishna, playing on a flute. The heavy jowl, the staring eye, and the
      blue-black moustache of the god made up a far-off resemblance to Mulvaney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The blaze was gone in a wink, but the whole schame came to me thin. I
      believe I was mad too. I slid the off-shutter open an&rsquo; rowled out into the
      dhark behind the elephint-head pillar, tucked up my trousies to my knees,
      slipped off my boots an&rsquo; tuk a general hould av all the pink linin&rsquo; av the
      palanquin. Glory be, ut ripped out like a woman&rsquo;s dhriss whin you tread on
      ut at a sergeants&rsquo; ball, an&rsquo; a bottle came with ut. I tuk the bottle an&rsquo; 
      the next minut I was out av the dhark av the pillar, the pink linin&rsquo; 
      wrapped round me most graceful, the music thunderin&rsquo; like kettledrums, an&rsquo; 
      a could draft blowin&rsquo; round my bare legs. By this hand that did ut, I was
      Khrishna tootlin&rsquo; on the flute&mdash;the god that the rig&rsquo;mental chaplain
      talks about. A sweet sight I must ha&rsquo; looked. I knew my eyes were big, and
      my face was wax-white, an&rsquo; at the worst I must ha&rsquo; looked like a ghost.
      But they took me for the livin&rsquo; god. The music stopped, and the women were
      dead dumb an&rsquo; I crooked my legs like a shepherd on a china basin, an&rsquo; I
      did the ghost-waggle with my feet as I had done ut at the rig&rsquo;mental
      theatre many times, an&rsquo; I slid acrost the width av that temple in front av
      the she-god tootlin&rsquo; on the beer bottle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot did you toot?&rsquo; demanded Ortheris the practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me? Oh!&rsquo; Mulvaney sprang up, suiting the action to the word, and sliding
      gravely in front of us, a dilapidated but imposing deity in the half
      light. &lsquo;I sang&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;Only say
     You&rsquo;ll be Mrs. Brallaghan.
     Don&rsquo;t say nay,
     Charmin&rsquo; Judy Callaghan.
</pre>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know me own voice when I sang. An&rsquo; oh! &lsquo;twas pitiful to see the
      women. The darlin&rsquo;s were down on their faces. Whin I passed the last wan I
      cud see her poor little fingers workin&rsquo; one in another as if she wanted to
      touch my feet. So I dhrew the tail av this pink overcoat over her head for
      the greater honour, an&rsquo; I slid into the dhark on the other side av the
      temple, and fetched up in the arms av a big fat priest. All I wanted was
      to get away clear. So I tuk him by his greasy throat an&rsquo; shut the speech
      out av him. &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Which way, ye fat heathen?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sez he.
      &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;White man, soldier man, common soldier man. Where in the
      name av confusion is the back door?&rdquo; The women in the temple were still on
      their faces, an&rsquo; a young priest was holdin&rsquo; out his arms above their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; sez my fat friend, duckin&rsquo; behind a big bull-god an&rsquo; divin&rsquo; 
      into a passage. Thin I remimbered that I must ha&rsquo; made the miraculous
      reputation av that temple for the next fifty years. &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; I sez,
      an&rsquo; I held out both my hands wid a wink. That ould thief smiled like a
      father. I tuk him by the back av the neck in case he should be wishful to
      put a knife into me unbeknownst, an&rsquo; I ran him up an&rsquo; down the passage
      twice to collect his sensibilities! &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; sez he, in English. &ldquo;Now
      you talk sense,&rdquo; I sez. &ldquo;Fwhat &lsquo;ll you give me for the use av that most
      iligant palanquin I have no time to take away?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; sez
      he. &ldquo;Is ut like?&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;But ye might give me my railway fare. I&rsquo;m far
      from my home an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done you a service.&rdquo; Bhoys, &lsquo;tis a good thing to be
      a priest. The ould man niver throubled himself to dhraw from a bank. As I
      will prove to you subsequint, he philandered all round the slack av his
      clothes an&rsquo; began dribblin&rsquo; ten-rupee notes, old gold mohurs, and rupees
      into my hand till I could hould no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You lie!&rsquo; said Ortheris. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re mad or sunstrook. A native don&rsquo;t give
      coin unless you cut it out o&rsquo; &lsquo;im. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then my lie an&rsquo; my sunstroke is concealed under that lump av sod yonder,&rsquo; 
      retorted Mulvaney unruffled, nodding across the scrub. &lsquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a dale
      more in nature than your squidgy little legs have iver taken you to,
      Orth&rsquo;ris, me son. Four hundred an&rsquo; thirty-four rupees by my reckonin&rsquo;, AN&rsquo; 
      a big fat gold necklace that I took from him as a remimbrancer, was our
      share in that business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; &lsquo;e give it you for love?&rsquo; said Ortheris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were alone in that passage. Maybe I was a trifle too pressin&rsquo;, but
      considher fwhat I had done for the good av the temple and the iverlastin&rsquo; 
      joy av those women. &lsquo;Twas cheap at the price. I wud ha&rsquo; taken more if I
      cud ha&rsquo; found ut. I turned the ould man upside down at the last, but he
      was milked dhry. Thin he opened a door in another passage an&rsquo; I found
      mysilf up to my knees in Benares river-water, an&rsquo; bad smellin&rsquo; ut is. More
      by token I had come out on the river-line close to the burnin&rsquo; ghat and
      contagious to a cracklin&rsquo; corpse. This was in the heart av the night, for
      I had been four hours in the temple. There was a crowd av boats tied up,
      so I tuk wan an&rsquo; wint across the river. Thin I came home acrost country,
      lyin&rsquo; up by day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How on earth did you manage?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did Sir Frederick Roberts get from Cabul to Candahar? He marched an&rsquo; 
      he niver tould how near he was to breakin&rsquo; down. That&rsquo;s why he is fwhat he
      is. An&rsquo; now&mdash;&rsquo; Mulvaney yawned portentously. &lsquo;Now I will go an&rsquo; give
      myself up for absince widout leave. It&rsquo;s eight an&rsquo; twenty days an&rsquo; the
      rough end of the colonel&rsquo;s tongue in orderly room, any way you look at ut.
      But &lsquo;tis cheap at the price.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mulvaney,&rsquo; said I softly. &lsquo;If there happens to be any sort of excuse that
      the colonel can in any way accept, I have a notion that you&rsquo;ll get nothing
      more than the dressing-gown. The new recruits are in, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word more, sorr. Is ut excuses the old man wants? &lsquo;Tis not my way,
      but he shall have thim. I&rsquo;ll tell him I was engaged in financial
      operations connected wid a church,&rsquo; and he flapped his way to cantonments
      and the cells, singing lustily&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;So they sent a corp&rsquo;ril&rsquo;s file,
     And they put me in the gyard-room
     For conduck unbecomin&rsquo; of a soldier.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And when he was lost in the midst of the moonlight we could hear the
      refrain&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bang upon the big drum, bash upon the cymbals,
     As we go marchin&rsquo; along, boys, oh!
     For although in this campaign
     There&rsquo;s no whisky nor champagne,
     We&rsquo;ll keep our spirits goin&rsquo; with a song, boys!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Therewith he surrendered himself to the joyful and almost weeping guard,
      and was made much of by his fellows. But to the colonel he said that he
      had been smitten with sunstroke and had lain insensible on a villager&rsquo;s
      cot for untold hours; and between laughter and goodwill the affair was
      smoothed over, so that he could, next day, teach the new recruits how to
      &lsquo;Fear God, Honour the Queen, Shoot Straight, and Keep Clean.&rsquo;

                          BARRACK-ROOM BALLAD.
</pre>
    <p>
      Al day I had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of
      the finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld. Thirty thousand
      troops had by the wisdom of the Government of India been turned loose over
      a few thousand square miles of country to practise in peace what they
      would never attempt in war. Consequently cavalry charged unshaken infantry
      at the trot. Infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks delivered in
      line of quarter columns, and mounted infantry skirmished up to the wheels
      of an armoured train which carried nothing more deadly than a twenty-five
      pounder Armstrong, two Nordenfeldts, and a few score volunteers all cased
      in three-eighths-inch boiler-plate. Yet it was a very lifelike camp.
      Operations did not cease at sundown; nobody knew the country and nobody
      spared man or horse. There was unending cavalry scouting and almost
      unending forced work over broken ground. The Army of the South had finally
      pierced the centre of the Army of the North, and was pouring through the
      gap hot-foot to capture a city of strategic importance. Its front extended
      fanwise, the sticks being represented by regiments strung out along the
      line of route backwards to the divisional transport columns and all the
      lumber that trails behind an army on the move. On its right the broken
      left of the Army of the North was flying in mass, chased by the Southern
      horse and hammered by the Southern guns till these had been pushed far
      beyond the limits of their last support. Then the flying sat down to rest,
      while the elated commandant of the pursuing force telegraphed that he held
      all in check and observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a flying
      column of Northern horse with a detachment of Ghoorkhas and British troops
      had been pushed round, as fast as the failing light allowed, to cut across
      the entire rear of the Southern Army, to break, as it were, all the ribs
      of the fan where they converged by striking at the transport, reserve
      ammunition, and artillery supplies. Their instructions were to go in,
      avoiding the few scouts who might not have been drawn off by the pursuit,
      and create sufficient excitement to impress the Southern Army with the
      wisdom of guarding their own flank and rear before they captured cities.
      It was a pretty manoeuvre, neatly carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking for the second division of the Southern Army, our first
      intimation of the attack was at twilight, when the artillery were
      labouring in deep sand, most of the escort were trying to help them out,
      and the main body of the infantry had gone on. A Noah&rsquo;s Ark of elephants,
      camels, and the mixed menagerie of an Indian transport-train bubbled and
      squealed behind the guns when there appeared from nowhere in particular
      British infantry to the extent of three companies, who sprang to the heads
      of the gun-horses and brought all to a standstill amid oaths and cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that, umpire?&rsquo; said the major commanding the attack, and with one
      voice the drivers and limber gunners answered &lsquo;Hout!&rsquo; while the colonel of
      artillery sputtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All your scouts are charging our main body,&rsquo; said the major. &lsquo;Your flanks
      are unprotected for two miles. I think we&rsquo;ve broken the back of this
      division. And listen,&mdash;there go the Ghoorkhas!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A weak fire broke from the rear-guard more than a mile away, and was
      answered by cheerful howlings. The Ghoorkhas, who should have swung clear
      of the second division, had stepped on its tail in the dark, but drawing
      off hastened to reach the next line of attack, which lay almost parallel
      to us five or six miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our column swayed and surged irresolutely,&mdash;three batteries, the
      divisional ammunition reserve, the baggage, and a section of the hospital
      and bearer corps. The commandant ruefully promised to report himself &lsquo;cut
      up&rsquo; to the nearest umpire, and commending his cavalry and all other
      cavalry to the special care of Eblis, toiled on to resume touch with the
      rest of the division.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll bivouac here to-night,&rsquo; said the major, &lsquo;I have a notion that the
      Ghoorkhas will get caught. They may want us to re-form on. Stand easy till
      the transport gets away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand caught my beast&rsquo;s bridle and led him out of the choking dust; a
      larger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle; and two of the hugest
      hands in the world received me sliding. Pleasant is the lot of the special
      correspondent who falls into such hands as those of Privates Mulvaney,
      Ortheris, and Learoyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said the Irishman calmly. &lsquo;We thought we&rsquo;d find
      you somewheres here by. Is there anything av yours in the transport?
      Orth&rsquo;ris &lsquo;ll fetch ut out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris did &lsquo;fetch ut out,&rsquo; from under the trunk of an elephant, in the
      shape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts. The
      little man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the brutil an&rsquo; licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the
      thruck,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, making practised investigations, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll loot
      ev&rsquo;rything. They&rsquo;re bein&rsquo; fed on iron-filin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; dog-biscuit these days,
      but glory&rsquo;s no compensation for a belly-ache. Praise be, we&rsquo;re here to
      protect you, sorr. Beer, sausage, bread (soft an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a cur&rsquo;osity),
      soup in a tin, whisky by the smell av ut, an&rsquo; fowls! Mother av Moses, but
      ye take the field like a confectioner! &lsquo;Tis scand&rsquo;lus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a orficer,&rsquo; said Ortheris significantly. &lsquo;When the sergent&rsquo;s done
      lushin&rsquo; the privit may clean the pot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bundled several things into Mulvaney&rsquo;s haversack before the major&rsquo;s hand
      fell on my shoulder and he said tenderly, &lsquo;Requisitioned for the Queen&rsquo;s
      service. Wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents: they are
      the soldier&rsquo;s best friends. Come and take pot-luck with us to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my well-considered
      commissariat melted away to reappear later at the mess-table, which was a
      waterproof sheet spread on the ground. The flying column had taken three
      days&rsquo; rations with it, and there be few things nastier than government
      rations&mdash;especially when government is experimenting with German
      toys. Erbsenwurst, tinned beef of surpassing tinniness, compressed
      vegetables, and meat-biscuits may be nourishing, but what Thomas Atkins
      needs is bulk in his inside. The major, assisted by his brother officers,
      purchased goats for the camp and so made the experiment of no effect. Long
      before the fatigue-party sent to collect brushwood had returned, the men
      were settled down by their valises, kettles and pots had appeared from the
      surrounding country and were dangling over fires as the kid and the
      compressed vegetable bubbled together; there rose a cheerful clinking of
      mess-tins; outrageous demands for &lsquo;a little more stuffin&rsquo; with that there
      liver-wing;&rsquo; and gust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as
      delicate as a gun-butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boys are in a good temper,&rsquo; said the major. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be singing
      presently. Well, a night like this is enough to keep them happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Over our heads burned the wonderful Indian stars, which are not all
      pricked in on one plane, but, preserving an orderly perspective, draw the
      eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of
      heaven itself. The earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky. We
      could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the
      jackals, the movement of the wind in the tamarisks, and the fitful mutter
      of musketry-fire leagues away to the left. A native woman from some unseen
      hut began to sing, the mail-train thundered past on its way to Delhi, and
      a roosting crow cawed drowsily. Then there was a belt-loosening silence
      about the fires, and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men, full fed, turned to tobacco and song,&mdash;their officers with
      them. The subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical
      critics in his regiment, and is honoured among the more intricate
      step-dancers. By him, as by him who plays cricket cleverly, Thomas Atkins
      will stand in time of need, when he will let a better officer go on alone.
      The ruined tombs of forgotten Mussulman saints heard the ballad of Agra
      Town, The Buffalo Battery, Marching to Kabul, The long, long Indian Day,
      The Place where the Punkah-coolie died, and that crashing chorus which
      announces,

      To-day, of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and
      lay and laughed round that water-proof sheet, not one remains. They went
      to camps that were not of exercise and battles without umpires. Burmah,
      the Soudan, and the frontier,&mdash;fever and fight,&mdash;took them in
      their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drifted across to the men&rsquo;s fires in search of Mulvaney, whom I found
      strategically greasing his feet by the blaze. There is nothing
      particularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long
      day&rsquo;s march, but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the &lsquo;might,
      majesty, dominion, and power&rsquo; of the British Empire which stands on those
      feet you take an interest in the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a blister, bad luck to ut, on the heel,&rsquo; said Mulvaney. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      touch ut. Prick ut out, little man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris took out his house-wife, eased the trouble with a needle, stabbed
      Mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon, and was swiftly kicked into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve bruk the best av my toes over you, ye grinnin&rsquo; child av disruption,&rsquo; 
      said Mulvaney, sitting cross-legged and nursing his feet; then seeing me,
      &lsquo;Oh, ut&rsquo;s you, sorr! Be welkim, an&rsquo; take that maraudin&rsquo; scutt&rsquo;s place.
      Jock, hold him down on the cindhers for a bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ortheris escaped and went elsewhere, as I took possession of the
      hollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat. Learoyd on
      the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the height av politeness for you,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, lighting his
      pipe with a flaming branch. &lsquo;But Jock&rsquo;s eaten half a box av your sardines
      at wan gulp, an&rsquo; I think the tin too. What&rsquo;s the best wid you, sorr, an&rsquo; 
      how did you happen to be on the losin&rsquo; side this day whin we captured
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Army of the South is winning all along the line,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then that line&rsquo;s the hangman&rsquo;s rope, savin&rsquo; your presence. You&rsquo;ll learn
      to-morrow how we rethreated to dhraw thim on before we made thim trouble,
      an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what a woman does. By the same tokin, we&rsquo;ll be attacked before
      the dawnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; ut would be betther not to slip your boots. How do I know
      that? By the light av pure reason. Here are three companies av us ever so
      far inside av the enemy&rsquo;s flank an&rsquo; a crowd av roarin&rsquo;, tarin&rsquo;, squealin&rsquo; 
      cavalry gone on just to turn out the whole hornet&rsquo;s nest av them. Av
      course the enemy will pursue, by brigades like as not, an&rsquo; thin we&rsquo;ll have
      to run for ut. Mark my words. I am av the opinion av Polonius whin he
      said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight wid ivry scutt for the pure joy av fightin&rsquo;, but if you
      do, knock the nose av him first an&rsquo; frequint.&rdquo; We ought to ha&rsquo; gone on an&rsquo; 
      helped the Ghoorkhas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what do you know about Polonius?&rsquo; I demanded. This was a new side of
      Mulvaney&rsquo;s character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that Shakespeare iver wrote an&rsquo; a dale more that the gallery
      shouted,&rsquo; said the man of war, carefully lacing his boots. &lsquo;Did I not tell
      you av Silver&rsquo;s theatre in Dublin, whin I was younger than I am now an&rsquo; a
      patron av the drama? Ould Silver wud never pay actor-man or woman their
      just dues, an&rsquo; by consequince his comp&rsquo;nies was collapsible at the last
      minut. Thin the bhoys wud clamour to take a part, an&rsquo; oft as not ould
      Silver made them pay for the fun. Faith, I&rsquo;ve seen Hamlut played wid a new
      black eye an&rsquo; the queen as full as a cornucopia. I remimber wanst Hogin
      that &lsquo;listed in the Black Tyrone an&rsquo; was shot in South Africa, he sejuced
      ould Silver into givin&rsquo; him Hamlut&rsquo;s part instid av me that had a fine
      fancy for rhetoric in those days. Av course I wint into the gallery an&rsquo; 
      began to fill the pit wid other people&rsquo;s hats, an&rsquo; I passed the time av
      day to Hogin walkin&rsquo; through Denmark like a hamstrung mule wid a pall on
      his back. &ldquo;Hamlut,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a hole in your heel. Pull up your
      shtockin&rsquo;s, Hamlut,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;Hamlut, Hamlut, for the love av decincy dhrop
      that skull an&rsquo; pull up your shtockin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The whole house begun to tell him
      that. He stopped his soliloquishms mid-between. &ldquo;My shtockin&rsquo;s may be
      comin&rsquo; down or they may not,&rdquo; sez he, screwin&rsquo; his eye into the gallery,
      for well he knew who I was. &ldquo;But afther this performince is over me an&rsquo; 
      the Ghost &lsquo;ll trample the tripes out av you, Terence, wid your ass&rsquo;s
      bray!&rdquo; An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s how I come to know about Hamlut. Eyah! Those days, those
      days! Did you iver have onendin&rsquo; devilmint an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to pay for it in
      your life, sorr?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, without having to pay,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s thrue! &lsquo;Tis mane whin you considher on ut; but ut&rsquo;s the same wid
      horse or fut. A headache if you dhrink, an&rsquo; a belly-ache if you eat too
      much, an&rsquo; a heart-ache to kape all down. Faith, the beast only gets the
      colic, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s the lucky man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his head and stared into the fire, fingering his moustache the
      while. From the far side of the bivouac the voice of Corbet-Nolan, senior
      subaltern of B company, uplifted itself in an ancient and much appreciated
      song of sentiment, the men moaning melodiously behind him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The north wind blew coldly, she drooped from that hour,
     My own little Kathleen, my sweet little Kathleen,
     Kathleen, my Kathleen, Kathleen O&rsquo;Moore!
</pre>
    <p>
      With forty-five O&rsquo;s in the last word: even at that distance you might have
      cut the soft South Irish accent with a shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For all we take we must pay, but the price is cruel high,&rsquo; murmured
      Mulvaney when the chorus had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rsquo; I said gently, for I knew that he was a man of an
      inextinguishable sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear now,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Ye know what I am now. <i>I</i> know what I mint to
      be at the beginnin&rsquo; av my service. I&rsquo;ve tould you time an&rsquo; again, an&rsquo; what
      I have not Dinah Shadd has. An&rsquo; what am I? Oh, Mary Mother av Hiven, an
      ould dhrunken, untrustable baste av a privit that has seen the reg&rsquo;ment
      change out from colonel to drummer-boy, not wanst or twice, but scores av
      times! Ay, scores! An&rsquo; me not so near gettin&rsquo; promotion as in the first!
      An&rsquo; me livin&rsquo; on an&rsquo; kapin&rsquo; clear av clink, not by my own good conduck,
      but the kindness av some orf&rsquo;cer-bhoy young enough to be son to me! Do I
      not know ut? Can I not tell whin I&rsquo;m passed over at p&rsquo;rade, tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
      rockin&rsquo; full av liquor an&rsquo; ready to fall all in wan piece, such as even a
      suckin&rsquo; child might see, bekaze, &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;tis only ould Mulvaney!&rdquo; An&rsquo; whin
      I&rsquo;m let off in ord&rsquo;ly-room through some thrick of the tongue an&rsquo; a ready
      answer an&rsquo; the ould man&rsquo;s mercy, is ut smilin&rsquo; I feel whin I fall away an&rsquo; 
      go back to Dinah Shadd, thryin&rsquo; to carry ut all off as a joke? Not I! &lsquo;Tis
      hell to me, dumb hell through ut all; an&rsquo; next time whin the fit comes I
      will be as bad again. Good cause the reg&rsquo;ment has to know me for the best
      soldier in ut. Better cause have I to know mesilf for the worst man. I&rsquo;m
      only fit to tache the new drafts what I&rsquo;ll niver learn mesilf; an&rsquo; I am
      sure, as tho&rsquo; I heard ut, that the minut wan av these pink-eyed recruities
      gets away from my &ldquo;Mind ye now,&rdquo; an&rsquo; &ldquo;Listen to this, Jim, bhoy,&rdquo;&mdash;sure
      I am that the sergint houlds me up to him for a warnin&rsquo;. So I tache, as
      they say at musketry-instruction, by direct and ricochet fire. Lord be
      good to me, for I have stud some throuble!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lie down and go to sleep,&rsquo; said I, not being able to comfort or advise.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the best man in the regiment, and, next to Ortheris, the biggest
      fool. Lie down and wait till we&rsquo;re attacked. What force will they turn
      out? Guns, think you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try that wid your lorrds an&rsquo; ladies, twistin&rsquo; an&rsquo; turnin&rsquo; the talk, tho&rsquo; 
      you mint ut well. Ye cud say nothin&rsquo; to help me, an&rsquo; yet ye niver knew
      what cause I had to be what I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Begin at the beginning and go on to the end,&rsquo; I said royally. &lsquo;But rake
      up the fire a bit first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed Ortheris&rsquo;s bayonet for a poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shows how little we know what we do,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, putting it
      aside. &lsquo;Fire takes all the heart out av the steel, an&rsquo; the next time, may
      be, that our little man is fighting for his life his bradawl &lsquo;ll break,
      an&rsquo; so you&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; killed him, manin&rsquo; no more than to kape yourself warm.
      &lsquo;Tis a recruity&rsquo;s thrick that. Pass the clanin&rsquo;-rod, sorr.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I snuggled down abased; and after an interval the voice of Mulvaney began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I iver tell you how Dinah Shadd came to be wife av mine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I dissembled a burning anxiety that I had felt for some months&mdash;ever
      since Dinah Shadd, the strong, the patient, and the infinitely tender, had
      of her own good love and free will washed a shirt for me, moving in a
      barren land where washing was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t remember,&rsquo; I said casually. &lsquo;Was it before or after you made love
      to Annie Bragin, and got no satisfaction?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Annie Bragin is written in another place. It is one of the
      many less respectable episodes in Mulvaney&rsquo;s chequered career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before&mdash;before&mdash;long before, was that business av Annie Bragin
      an&rsquo; the corp&rsquo;ril&rsquo;s ghost. Niver woman was the worse for me whin I had
      married Dinah. There&rsquo;s a time for all things, an&rsquo; I know how to kape all
      things in place&mdash;barrin&rsquo; the dhrink, that kapes me in my place wid no
      hope av comin&rsquo; to be aught else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Begin at the beginning,&rsquo; I insisted. &lsquo;Mrs. Mulvaney told me that you
      married her when you were quartered in Krab Bokhar barracks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; the same is a cess-pit,&rsquo; said Mulvaney piously. &lsquo;She spoke thrue, did
      Dinah. &lsquo;Twas this way. Talkin&rsquo; av that, have ye iver fallen in love,
      sorr?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I preserved the silence of the damned. Mulvaney continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thin I will assume that ye have not. <i>I</i> did. In the days av my
      youth, as I have more than wanst tould you, I was a man that filled the
      eye an&rsquo; delighted the sowl av women. Niver man was hated as I have bin.
      Niver man was loved as I&mdash;no, not within half a day&rsquo;s march av ut!
      For the first five years av my service, whin I was what I wud give my sowl
      to be now, I tuk whatever was within my reach an&rsquo; digested ut&mdash;an
      that&rsquo;s more than most men can say. Dhrink I tuk, an&rsquo; ut did me no harm. By
      the Hollow av Hiven, I cud play wid four women at wanst, an&rsquo; kape them
      from findin&rsquo; out anythin&rsquo; about the other three, an&rsquo; smile like a
      full-blown marigold through ut all. Dick Coulhan, av the battery we&rsquo;ll
      have down on us to-night, could drive his team no betther than I mine, an&rsquo; 
      I hild the worser cattle! An&rsquo; so I lived, an&rsquo; so I was happy till afther
      that business wid Annie Bragin&mdash;she that turned me off as cool as a
      meat-safe, an&rsquo; taught me where I stud in the mind av an honest woman.
      &lsquo;Twas no sweet dose to swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afther that I sickened awhile an&rsquo; tuk thought to my reg&rsquo;mental work;
      conceiting mesilf I wud study an&rsquo; be a sergint, an&rsquo; a major-gineral twinty
      minutes afther that. But on top av my ambitiousness there was an empty
      place in my sowl, an&rsquo; me own opinion av mesilf cud not fill ut. Sez I to
      mesilf, &ldquo;Terence, you&rsquo;re a great man an&rsquo; the best set-up in the reg&rsquo;mint.
      Go on an&rsquo; get promotion.&rdquo; Sez mesilf to me, &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Sez I to mesilf,
      &ldquo;For the glory av ut!&rdquo; Sez mesilf to me, &ldquo;Will that fill these two strong
      arrums av yours, Terence?&rdquo; &ldquo;Go to the devil,&rdquo; sez I to mesilf. &ldquo;Go to the
      married lines,&rdquo; sez mesilf to me. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the same thing,&rdquo; sez I to mesilf.
      &ldquo;Av you&rsquo;re the same man, ut is,&rdquo; said mesilf to me; an&rsquo; wid that I
      considhered on ut a long while. Did you iver feel that way, sorr?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I snored gently, knowing that if Mulvaney were uninterrupted he would go
      on. The clamour from the bivouac fires beat up to the stars, as the rival
      singers of the companies were pitted against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I felt that way an&rsquo; a bad time ut was. Wanst, bein&rsquo; a fool, I wint
      into the married lines more for the sake av spakin&rsquo; to our ould
      colour-sergint Shadd than for any thruck wid women-folk. I was a corp&rsquo;ril
      then&mdash;rejuced aftherwards, but a corp&rsquo;ril then. I&rsquo;ve got a photograft
      av mesilf to prove ut. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a cup av tay wid us?&rdquo; sez Shadd. &ldquo;I
      will that,&rdquo; I sez, &ldquo;tho&rsquo; tay is not my divarsion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Twud be better for you if ut were,&rdquo; sez ould Mother Shadd, an&rsquo; she had
      ought to know, for Shadd, in the ind av his service, dhrank bung-full each
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wid that I tuk off my gloves&mdash;there was pipe-clay in thim, so that
      they stud alone&mdash;an&rsquo; pulled up my chair, lookin&rsquo; round at the china
      ornaments an&rsquo; bits av things in the Shadds&rsquo; quarters. They were things
      that belonged to a man, an&rsquo; no camp-kit, here to-day an&rsquo; dishipated next.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re comfortable in this place, sergint,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis the wife that
      did ut, boy,&rdquo; sez he, pointin&rsquo; the stem av his pipe to ould Mother Shadd,
      an&rsquo; she smacked the top av his bald head apon the compliment. &ldquo;That manes
      you want money,&rdquo; sez she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; thin&mdash;an&rsquo; thin whin the kettle was to be filled, Dinah came in&mdash;my
      Dinah&mdash;her sleeves rowled up to the elbow an&rsquo; her hair in a winkin&rsquo; 
      glory over her forehead, the big blue eyes beneath twinklin&rsquo; like stars on
      a frosty night, an&rsquo; the tread av her two feet lighter than waste-paper
      from the colonel&rsquo;s basket in ord&rsquo;ly-room whin ut&rsquo;s emptied. Bein&rsquo; but a
      shlip av a girl she went pink at seein&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; I twisted me moustache an&rsquo; 
      looked at a picture forninst the wall. Niver show a woman that ye care the
      snap av a finger for her, an&rsquo; begad she&rsquo;ll come bleatin&rsquo; to your
      boot-heels!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s why you followed Annie Bragin till everybody in the
      married quarters laughed at you,&rsquo; said I, remembering that unhallowed
      wooing and casting off the disguise of drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m layin&rsquo; down the gin&rsquo;ral theory av the attack,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, driving
      his boot into the dying fire. &lsquo;If you read the Soldier&rsquo;s Pocket Book,
      which niver any soldier reads, you&rsquo;ll see that there are exceptions. Whin
      Dinah was out av the door (an&rsquo; &lsquo;twas as tho&rsquo; the sunlight had shut too)&mdash;&ldquo;Mother
      av Hiven, sergint,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;but is that your daughter?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      believed that way these eighteen years,&rdquo; sez ould Shadd, his eyes
      twinklin&rsquo;; &ldquo;but Mrs. Shadd has her own opinion, like iv&rsquo;ry woman,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      wid yours this time, for a mericle,&rdquo; sez Mother Shadd. &ldquo;Thin why in the
      name av fortune did I niver see her before?&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Bekaze you&rsquo;ve been
      thrapesin&rsquo; round wid the married women these three years past. She was a
      bit av a child till last year, an&rsquo; she shot up wid the spring,&rdquo; sez ould
      Mother Shadd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thrapese no more,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you mane that?&rdquo; sez ould
      Mother Shadd, lookin&rsquo; at me side-ways like a hen looks at a hawk whin the
      chickens are runnin&rsquo; free. &ldquo;Try me, an&rsquo; tell,&rdquo; sez I. Wid that I pulled on
      my gloves, dhrank off the tay, an&rsquo; went out av the house as stiff as at
      gin&rsquo;ral p&rsquo;rade, for well I knew that Dinah Shadd&rsquo;s eyes were in the small
      av my back out av the scullery window. Faith! that was the only time I
      mourned I was not a cav&rsquo;lry-man for the pride av the spurs to jingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wint out to think, an&rsquo; I did a powerful lot av thinkin&rsquo;, but ut all
      came round to that shlip av a girl in the dotted blue dhress, wid the blue
      eyes an&rsquo; the sparkil in them. Thin I kept off canteen, an&rsquo; I kept to the
      married quarthers, or near by, on the chanst av meetin&rsquo; Dinah. Did I meet
      her? Oh, my time past, did I not; wid a lump in my throat as big as my
      valise an&rsquo; my heart goin&rsquo; like a farrier&rsquo;s forge on a Saturday morning?
      &lsquo;Twas &ldquo;Good day to ye, Miss Dinah,&rdquo; an&rsquo; &ldquo;Good day t&rsquo;you, corp&rsquo;ril,&rdquo; for a
      week or two, and divil a bit further could I get bekaze av the respect I
      had to that girl that I cud ha&rsquo; broken betune finger an&rsquo; thumb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I giggled as I recalled the gigantic figure of Dinah Shadd when she
      handed me my shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye may laugh,&rsquo; grunted Mulvaney. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; the trut&rsquo;, an &lsquo;tis you
      that are in fault. Dinah was a girl that wud ha&rsquo; taken the imperiousness
      out av the Duchess av Clonmel in those days. Flower hand, foot av shod
      air, an&rsquo; the eyes av the livin&rsquo; mornin&rsquo; she had that is my wife to-day&mdash;ould
      Dinah, and niver aught else than Dinah Shadd to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas after three weeks standin&rsquo; off an&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; niver makin&rsquo; headway
      excipt through the eyes, that a little drummer-boy grinned in me face whin
      I had admonished him wid the buckle av my belt for riotin&rsquo; all over the
      place. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not the only wan that doesn&rsquo;t kape to barricks,&rdquo; sez he. I
      tuk him by the scruff av his neck,&mdash;my heart was hung on a
      hair-thrigger those days, you will onderstand&mdash;an&rsquo; &ldquo;Out wid ut,&rdquo; sez
      I, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll lave no bone av you unbreakable.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Speak to Dempsey,&rdquo;
       sez he howlin&rsquo;. &ldquo;Dempsey which?&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;ye unwashed limb av Satan.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Av
      the Bob-tailed Dhragoons,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen her home from her aunt&rsquo;s
      house in the civil lines four times this fortnight.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Child!&rdquo; sez I,
      dhroppin&rsquo; him, &ldquo;your tongue&rsquo;s stronger than your body. Go to your
      quarters. I&rsquo;m sorry I dhressed you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At that I went four ways to wanst huntin&rsquo; Dempsey. I was mad to think
      that wid all my airs among women I shud ha&rsquo; been chated by a basin-faced
      fool av a cav&rsquo;lry-man not fit to trust on a trunk. Presintly I found him
      in our lines&mdash;the Bobtails was quartered next us&mdash;an&rsquo; a tallowy,
      topheavy son av a she-mule he was wid his big brass spurs an&rsquo; his
      plastrons on his epigastrons an&rsquo; all. But he niver flinched a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;A word wid you, Dempsey,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve walked wid Dinah Shadd four
      times this fortnight gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk forty times more, an&rsquo; forty on
      top av that, ye shovel-futted clod-breakin&rsquo; infantry lance-corp&rsquo;ril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before I cud gyard he had his gloved fist home on my cheek an&rsquo; down I
      went full-sprawl. &ldquo;Will that content you?&rdquo; sez he, blowin&rsquo; on his knuckles
      for all the world like a Scots Greys orf&rsquo;cer. &ldquo;Content!&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;For your
      own sake, man, take off your spurs, peel your jackut, an&rsquo; onglove. &lsquo;Tis
      the beginnin&rsquo; av the overture; stand up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He stud all he know, but he niver peeled his jackut, an&rsquo; his shoulders
      had no fair play. I was fightin&rsquo; for Dinah Shadd an&rsquo; that cut on my cheek.
      What hope had he forninst me? &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; sez I, time an&rsquo; again whin he
      was beginnin&rsquo; to quarter the ground an&rsquo; gyard high an&rsquo; go large. &ldquo;This
      isn&rsquo;t ridin&rsquo;-school,&rdquo; I sez. &ldquo;O man, stand up an&rsquo; let me get in at ye.&rdquo;
       But whin I saw he wud be runnin&rsquo; about, I grup his shtock in my left an&rsquo; 
      his waist-belt in my right an&rsquo; swung him clear to my right front, head
      undher, he hammerin&rsquo; my nose till the wind was knocked out av him on the
      bare ground. &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll kick your head into your chest!&rdquo;
       and I wud ha&rsquo; done ut too, so ragin&rsquo; mad I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;My collar-bone&rsquo;s bruk,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Help me back to lines. I&rsquo;ll walk wid
      her no more.&rdquo; So I helped him back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was his collar-bone broken?&rsquo; I asked, for I fancied that only Learoyd
      could neatly accomplish that terrible throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He pitched on his left shoulder-point. Ut was. Next day the news was in
      both barricks, an&rsquo; whin I met Dinah Shadd wid a cheek on me like all the
      reg&rsquo;mintal tailor&rsquo;s samples there was no &ldquo;Good mornin&rsquo;, corp&rsquo;ril,&rdquo; or
      aught else. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what have I done, Miss Shadd,&rdquo; sez I, very bould,
      plantin&rsquo; mesilf forninst her, &ldquo;that ye should not pass the time of day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve half-killed rough-rider Dempsey,&rdquo; sez she, her dear blue eyes
      fillin&rsquo; up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Was he a friend av yours that saw ye home four times in
      the fortnight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sez she, but her mouth was down at the corners. &ldquo;An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; 
      what&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo; she sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ask Dempsey,&rdquo; sez I, purtendin&rsquo; to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Did you fight for me then, ye silly man?&rdquo; she sez, tho&rsquo; she knew ut all
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; sez I, an&rsquo; I tuk wan pace to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t worth ut,&rdquo; sez she, fingerin&rsquo; in her apron,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me to say,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Shall I say ut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sez she in a saint&rsquo;s whisper, an&rsquo; at that I explained mesilf; and
      she tould me what ivry man that is a man, an&rsquo; many that is a woman, hears
      wanst in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;But what made ye cry at startin&rsquo;, Dinah, darlin&rsquo;?&rsquo;&rdquo; sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Your&mdash;your bloody cheek,&rdquo; sez she, duckin&rsquo; her little head down on
      my sash (I was on duty for the day) an&rsquo; whimperin&rsquo; like a sorrowful angil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now a man cud take that two ways. I tuk ut as pleased me best an&rsquo; my
      first kiss wid ut. Mother av Innocence! but I kissed her on the tip av the
      nose an&rsquo; undher the eye; an&rsquo; a girl that let&rsquo;s a kiss come tumble-ways
      like that has never been kissed before. Take note av that, sorr. Thin we
      wint hand in hand to ould Mother Shadd like two little childher, an&rsquo; she
      said &lsquo;twas no bad thing, an&rsquo; ould Shadd nodded behind his pipe, an&rsquo; Dinah
      ran away to her own room. That day I throd on rollin&rsquo; clouds. All earth
      was too small to hould me. Begad, I cud ha&rsquo; hiked the sun out av the sky
      for a live coal to my pipe, so magnificent I was. But I tuk recruities at
      squad-drill instid, an&rsquo; began wid general battalion advance whin I shud
      ha&rsquo; been balance-steppin&rsquo; them. Eyah! that day! that day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A very long pause. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas all wrong,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, with an enormous sigh. &lsquo;An&rsquo; I know that
      ev&rsquo;ry bit av ut was my own foolishness. That night I tuk maybe the half av
      three pints&mdash;not enough to turn the hair of a man in his natural
      senses. But I was more than half drunk wid pure joy, an&rsquo; that canteen beer
      was so much whisky to me. I can&rsquo;t tell how it came about, but BEKAZE I had
      no thought for anywan except Dinah, BEKAZE I hadn&rsquo;t slipped her little
      white arms from my neck five minuts, BEKAZE the breath of her kiss was not
      gone from my mouth, I must go through the married lines on my way to
      quarters an&rsquo; I must stay talkin&rsquo; to a red-headed Mullingar heifer av a
      girl, Judy Sheehy, that was daughter to Mother Sheehy, the wife of Nick
      Sheehy, the canteen-sergint&mdash;the Black Curse av Shielygh be on the
      whole brood that are above groun&rsquo; this day!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; what are ye houldin&rsquo; your head that high for, corp&rsquo;ril?&rdquo; sez Judy.
      &ldquo;Come in an&rsquo; thry a cup av tay,&rdquo; she sez, standin&rsquo; in the doorway. Bein&rsquo; 
      an ontrustable fool, an&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; av anything but tay, I wint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s at canteen,&rdquo; sez Judy, smoothin&rsquo; the hair av hers that was like
      red snakes, an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at me cornerways out av her green cats&rsquo; eyes. &ldquo;Ye
      will not mind, corp&rsquo;ril?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I can endure,&rdquo; sez I; ould Mother Sheehy bein&rsquo; no divarsion av mine, nor
      her daughter too. Judy fetched the tea things an&rsquo; put thim on the table,
      leanin&rsquo; over me very close to get thim square. I dhrew back, thinkin&rsquo; av
      Dinah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is ut afraid you are av a girl alone?&rdquo; sez Judy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Why should I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;That rests wid the girl,&rdquo; sez Judy, dhrawin&rsquo; her chair next to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Thin there let ut rest,&rdquo; sez I; an&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d been a trifle onpolite,
      I sez, &ldquo;The tay&rsquo;s not quite sweet enough for my taste. Put your little
      finger in the cup, Judy. &lsquo;Twill make ut necthar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s necthar?&rdquo; sez she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Somethin&rsquo; very sweet,&rdquo; sez I; an&rsquo; for the sinful life av me I cud not
      help lookin&rsquo; at her out av the corner av my eye, as I was used to look at
      a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Go on wid ye, corp&rsquo;ril,&rdquo; sez she. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a flirrt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;On me sowl I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a cruel handsome man, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; sez she, heaving
      big sighs an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; crossways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You know your own mind,&rdquo; sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Twud be better for me if I did not,&rdquo; she sez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dale to be said on both sides av that,&rdquo; sez I, unthinkin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Say your own part av ut, then, Terence, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; sez she; &ldquo;for begad
      I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said too much or too little for an honest girl,&rdquo; an&rsquo; wid
      that she put her arms round my neck an&rsquo; kissed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no more to be said afther that,&rdquo; sez I, kissin&rsquo; her back again&mdash;Oh
      the mane scutt that I was, my head ringin&rsquo; wid Dinah Shadd! How does ut
      come about, sorr, that when a man has put the comether on wan woman, he&rsquo;s
      sure bound to put it on another? &lsquo;Tis the same thing at musketry. Wan day
      ivry shot goes wide or into the bank, an&rsquo; the next, lay high lay low,
      sight or snap, ye can&rsquo;t get off the bull&rsquo;s-eye for ten shots runnin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That only happens to a man who has had a good deal of experience. He does
      it without thinking,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thankin&rsquo; you for the complimint, sorr, ut may be so. But I&rsquo;m doubtful
      whether you mint ut for a complimint. Hear now; I sat there wid Judy on my
      knee tellin&rsquo; me all manner av nonsinse an&rsquo; only sayin&rsquo; &ldquo;yes&rdquo; an&rsquo; &ldquo;no,&rdquo;
       when I&rsquo;d much better ha&rsquo; kept tongue betune teeth. An&rsquo; that was not an
      hour afther I had left Dinah! What I was thinkin&rsquo; av I cannot say.
      Presintly, quiet as a cat, ould Mother Sheehy came in velvet-dhrunk. She
      had her daughter&rsquo;s red hair, but &lsquo;twas bald in patches, an&rsquo; I cud see in
      her wicked ould face, clear as lightnin&rsquo;, what Judy wud be twenty years to
      come. I was for jumpin&rsquo; up, but Judy niver moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Terence has promust, mother,&rdquo; sez she, an&rsquo; the could sweat bruk out all
      over me. Ould Mother Sheehy sat down of a heap an&rsquo; began playin&rsquo; wid the
      cups. &ldquo;Thin you&rsquo;re a well-matched pair,&rdquo; she sez very thick. &ldquo;For he&rsquo;s the
      biggest rogue that iver spoiled the queen&rsquo;s shoe-leather&rdquo; an&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off, Judy,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Ye should not talk nonsinse to your mother. Get
      her to bed, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Nonsinse!&rdquo; sez the ould woman, prickin&rsquo; up her ears like a cat an&rsquo; 
      grippin&rsquo; the table-edge. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill be the most nonsinsical nonsinse for you,
      ye grinnin&rsquo; badger, if nonsinse &lsquo;tis. Git clear, you. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ran out into the dhark, my head in a stew an&rsquo; my heart sick, but I had
      sinse enough to see that I&rsquo;d brought ut all on mysilf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this to pass
      the time av day to a panjandhrum av hell-cats,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve said,
      an&rsquo; what I&rsquo;ve not said do not matther. Judy an&rsquo; her dam will hould me for
      a promust man, an&rsquo; Dinah will give me the go, an&rsquo; I desarve ut. I will go
      an&rsquo; get dhrunk,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo; forget about ut, for &lsquo;tis plain I&rsquo;m not a
      marrin&rsquo; man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my way to canteen I ran against Lascelles, colour-sergint that was av
      E Comp&rsquo;ny, a hard, hard man, wid a torment av a wife. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve the head av
      a drowned man on your shoulders,&rdquo; sez he; &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; where you&rsquo;ll
      get a worse wan. Come back,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thrown my
      luck over the wall wid my own hand!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s not the way to get
      ut back again,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Have out wid your throuble, ye fool-bhoy.&rdquo; An&rsquo; I
      tould him how the matther was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He sucked in his lower lip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been thrapped,&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Ju Sheehy
      wud be the betther for a man&rsquo;s name to hers as soon as can. An&rsquo; we thought
      ye&rsquo;d put the comether on her,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the natural vanity of the
      baste, Terence, you&rsquo;re a big born fool, but you&rsquo;re not bad enough to marry
      into that comp&rsquo;ny. If you said anythin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; for all your protestations
      I&rsquo;m sure ye did&mdash;or did not, which is worse,&mdash;eat ut all&mdash;lie
      like the father of all lies, but come out av ut free av Judy. Do I not
      know what ut is to marry a woman that was the very spit an&rsquo; image av Judy
      whin she was young? I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; old an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve larnt patience, but you,
      Terence, you&rsquo;d raise hand on Judy an&rsquo; kill her in a year. Never mind if
      Dinah gives you the go, you&rsquo;ve desarved ut; never mind if the whole
      reg&rsquo;mint laughs you all day. Get shut av Judy an&rsquo; her mother. They can&rsquo;t
      dhrag you to church, but if they do, they&rsquo;ll dhrag you to hell. Go back to
      your quarters and lie down,&rdquo; sez he. Thin over his shoulder, &ldquo;You MUST ha&rsquo; 
      done with thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next day I wint to see Dinah, but there was no tucker in me as I walked.
      I knew the throuble wud come soon enough widout any handlin&rsquo; av mine, an&rsquo; 
      I dreaded ut sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard Judy callin&rsquo; me, but I hild straight on to the Shadds&rsquo; quarthers,
      an&rsquo; Dinah wud ha&rsquo; kissed me but I put her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Whin all&rsquo;s said, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;you can give ut me if ye will, tho&rsquo; I
      misdoubt &lsquo;twill be so easy to come by then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had scarce begun to put the explanation into shape before Judy an&rsquo; her
      mother came to the door. I think there was a verandah, but I&rsquo;m forgettin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Will ye not step in?&rdquo; sez Dinah, pretty and polite, though the Shadds
      had no dealin&rsquo;s with the Sheehys. Ould Mother Shadd looked up quick, an&rsquo; 
      she was the fust to see the throuble; for Dinah was her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pressed for time to-day,&rdquo; sez Judy as bould as brass; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve only
      come for Terence,&mdash;my promust man. &lsquo;Tis strange to find him here the
      day afther the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dinah looked at me as though I had hit her, an&rsquo; I answered straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;There was some nonsinse last night at the Sheehys&rsquo; quarthers, an&rsquo; Judy&rsquo;s
      carryin&rsquo; on the joke, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; sez I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;At the Sheehys&rsquo; quarthers?&rdquo; sez Dinah very slow, an&rsquo; Judy cut in wid:
      &ldquo;He was there from nine till ten, Dinah Shadd, an&rsquo; the betther half av
      that time I was sittin&rsquo; on his knee, Dinah Shadd. Ye may look and ye may
      look an&rsquo; ye may look me up an&rsquo; down, but ye won&rsquo;t look away that Terence
      is my promust man. Terence, darlin&rsquo;, &lsquo;tis time for us to be comin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dinah Shadd niver said word to Judy. &ldquo;Ye left me at half-past eight,&rdquo; she
      sez to me, &ldquo;an I niver thought that ye&rsquo;d leave me for Judy,&mdash;promises
      or no promises. Go back wid her, you that have to be fetched by a girl!
      I&rsquo;m done with you,&rdquo; sez she, and she ran into her own room, her mother
      followin&rsquo;. So I was alone wid those two women and at liberty to spake my
      sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Judy Sheehy,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;if you made a fool av me betune the lights you
      shall not do ut in the day. I niver promised you words or lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; sez ould Mother Sheehy, &ldquo;an&rsquo; may ut choke you where you
      stand!&rdquo; She was far gone in dhrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;An&rsquo; tho&rsquo; ut choked me where I stud I&rsquo;d not change,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Go home,
      Judy. I take shame for a decent girl like you dhraggin&rsquo; your mother out
      bare-headed on this errand. Hear now, and have ut for an answer. I gave my
      word to Dinah Shadd yesterday, an&rsquo;, more blame to me, I was wid you last
      night talkin&rsquo; nonsinse but nothin&rsquo; more. You&rsquo;ve chosen to thry to hould me
      on ut. I will not be held thereby for anythin&rsquo; in the world. Is that
      enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Judy wint pink all over. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I wish you joy av the perjury,&rdquo; sez she,
      duckin&rsquo; a curtsey. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost a woman that would ha&rsquo; wore her hand to
      the bone for your pleasure; an&rsquo; &lsquo;deed, Terence, ye were not thrapped...&rdquo;
       Lascelles must ha&rsquo; spoken plain to her. &ldquo;I am such as Dinah is&mdash;&lsquo;deed
      I am! Ye&rsquo;ve lost a fool av a girl that&rsquo;ll niver look at you again, an&rsquo; 
      ye&rsquo;ve lost what he niver had,&mdash;your common honesty. If you manage
      your men as you manage your love-makin&rsquo;, small wondher they call you the
      worst corp&rsquo;ril in the comp&rsquo;ny. Come away, mother,&rdquo; sez she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But divil a fut would the ould woman budge! &ldquo;D&rsquo;you hould by that?&rdquo; sez
      she, peerin&rsquo; up under her thick gray eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; wud,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;tho&rsquo; Dinah give me the go twinty times. I&rsquo;ll have
      no thruck with you or yours,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Take your child away, ye shameless
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; am I shameless?&rdquo; sez she, bringin&rsquo; her hands up above her head.
      &ldquo;Thin what are you, ye lyin&rsquo;, schamin&rsquo;, weak-kneed, dhirty-souled son av a
      sutler? Am <i>I</i> shameless? Who put the open shame on me an&rsquo; my child
      that we shud go beggin&rsquo; through the lines in the broad daylight for the
      broken word of a man? Double portion of my shame be on you, Terence
      Mulvaney, that think yourself so strong! By Mary and the saints, by blood
      and water an&rsquo; by ivry sorrow that came into the world since the beginnin&rsquo;,
      the black blight fall on you and yours, so that you may niver be free from
      pain for another when ut&rsquo;s not your own! May your heart bleed in your
      breast drop by drop wid all your friends laughin&rsquo; at the bleedin&rsquo;! Strong
      you think yourself? May your strength be a curse to you to dhrive you into
      the divil&rsquo;s hands against your own will! Clear-eyed you are? May your eyes
      see clear ivry step av the dark path you take till the hot cindhers av
      hell put thim out! May the ragin&rsquo; dry thirst in my own ould bones go to
      you that you shall niver pass bottle full nor glass empty. God preserve
      the light av your onderstandin&rsquo; to you, my jewel av a bhoy, that ye may
      niver forget what you mint to be an&rsquo; do, whin you&rsquo;re wallowin&rsquo; in the
      muck! May ye see the betther and follow the worse as long as there&rsquo;s
      breath in your body; an&rsquo; may ye die quick in a strange land, watchin&rsquo; your
      death before ut takes you, an&rsquo; enable to stir hand or foot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard a scufflin&rsquo; in the room behind, and thin Dinah Shadd&rsquo;s hand
      dhropped into mine like a rose-leaf into a muddy road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The half av that I&rsquo;ll take,&rdquo; sez she, &ldquo;an&rsquo; more too if I can. Go home,
      ye silly talkin&rsquo; woman,&mdash;go home an&rsquo; confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Come away! Come away!&rdquo; sez Judy, pullin&rsquo; her mother by the shawl. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas
      none av Terence&rsquo;s fault. For the love av Mary stop the talkin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; you!&rdquo; said ould Mother Sheehy, spinnin&rsquo; round forninst Dinah. &ldquo;Will
      ye take the half av that man&rsquo;s load? Stand off from him, Dinah Shadd,
      before he takes you down too&mdash;you that look to be a
      quarther-master-sergeant&rsquo;s wife in five years. You look too high, child.
      You shall WASH for the quarther-master-sergeant, whin he plases to give
      you the job out av charity; but a privit&rsquo;s wife you shall be to the end,
      an&rsquo; ivry sorrow of a privit&rsquo;s wife you shall know and niver a joy but wan,
      that shall go from you like the running tide from a rock. The pain av
      bearin&rsquo; you shall know but niver the pleasure av giving the breast; an&rsquo; 
      you shall put away a man-child into the common ground wid niver a priest
      to say a prayer over him, an&rsquo; on that man-child ye shall think ivry day av
      your life. Think long, Dinah Shadd, for you&rsquo;ll niver have another tho&rsquo; you
      pray till your knees are bleedin&rsquo;. The mothers av childher shall mock you
      behind your back when you&rsquo;re wringing over the wash-tub. You shall know
      what ut is to help a dhrunken husband home an&rsquo; see him go to the
      gyard-room. Will that plase you, Dinah Shadd, that won&rsquo;t be seen talkin&rsquo; 
      to my daughter? You shall talk to worse than Judy before all&rsquo;s over. The
      sergints&rsquo; wives shall look down on you contemptuous, daughter av a
      sergint, an&rsquo; you shall cover ut all up wid a smiling face when your
      heart&rsquo;s burstin&rsquo;. Stand off av him, Dinah Shadd, for I&rsquo;ve put the Black
      Curse of Shielygh upon him an&rsquo; his own mouth shall make ut good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She pitched forward on her head an&rsquo; began foamin&rsquo; at the mouth. Dinah
      Shadd ran out wid water, an&rsquo; Judy dhragged the ould woman into the
      verandah till she sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m old an&rsquo; forlore,&rdquo; she sez, thremblin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cryin&rsquo;, &ldquo;and &lsquo;tis like I
      say a dale more than I mane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re able to walk,&mdash;go,&rdquo; says ould Mother Shadd. &ldquo;This house
      has no place for the likes av you that have cursed my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Eyah!&rdquo; said the ould woman. &ldquo;Hard words break no bones, an&rsquo; Dinah
      Shadd&rsquo;ll kape the love av her husband till my bones are green corn. Judy
      darlin&rsquo;, I misremember what I came here for. Can you lend us the bottom av
      a taycup av tay, Mrs. Shadd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Judy dhragged her off cryin&rsquo; as tho&rsquo; her heart wud break. An&rsquo; Dinah
      Shadd an&rsquo; I, in ten minutes we had forgot ut all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you remember it now?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is ut like I&rsquo;d forget? Ivry word that wicked ould woman spoke fell thrue
      in my life aftherwards, an&rsquo; I cud ha&rsquo; stud ut all&mdash;stud ut all&mdash;excipt
      when my little Shadd was born. That was on the line av march three months
      afther the regiment was taken with cholera. We were betune Umballa an&rsquo; 
      Kalka thin, an&rsquo; I was on picket. Whin I came off duty the women showed me
      the child, an&rsquo; ut turned on uts side an&rsquo; died as I looked. We buried him
      by the road, an&rsquo; Father Victor was a day&rsquo;s march behind wid the heavy
      baggage, so the comp&rsquo;ny captain read a prayer. An&rsquo; since then I&rsquo;ve been a
      childless man, an&rsquo; all else that ould Mother Sheehy put upon me an&rsquo; Dinah
      Shadd. What do you think, sorr?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought a good deal, but it seemed better then to reach out for
      Mulvaney&rsquo;s hand. The demonstration nearly cost me the use of three
      fingers. Whatever he knows of his weaknesses, Mulvaney is entirely
      ignorant of his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what do you think?&rsquo; he repeated, as I was straightening out the
      crushed fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reply was drowned in yells and outcries from the next fire, where ten
      men were shouting for &lsquo;Orth&rsquo;ris,&rsquo; &lsquo;Privit Orth&rsquo;ris,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mistah Or&mdash;ther&mdash;ris!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Deah boy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Orth&rsquo;ris,&rsquo; &lsquo;Field-Marshal Orth&rsquo;ris,&rsquo; &lsquo;Stanley, you
      pen&rsquo;north o&rsquo; pop, come &lsquo;ere to your own comp&rsquo;ny!&rsquo; And the cockney, who had
      been delighting another audience with recondite and Rabelaisian yarns, was
      shot down among his admirers by the major force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve crumpled my dress-shirt &lsquo;orrid,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;an&rsquo; I shan&rsquo;t sing no
      more to this &lsquo;ere bloomin&rsquo; drawin&rsquo;-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Learoyd, roused by the confusion, uncoiled himself, crept behind Ortheris,
      and slung him aloft on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sing, ye bloomin&rsquo; hummin&rsquo; bird!&rsquo; said he, and Ortheris, beating time on
      Learoyd&rsquo;s skull, delivered himself, in the raucous voice of the Ratcliffe
      Highway, of this song:&mdash;

 To Love&rsquo;s low voice she lent a careless ear;
 Her hand within his rosy fingers lay,
 A chilling weight. She would not turn or hear;
 But with averted face went on her way.
 But when pale Death, all featureless and grim,
 Lifted his bony hand, and beckoning
 Held out his cypress-wreath, she followed him,
 And Love was left forlorn and wondering,
 That she who for his bidding would not stay,
 At Death&rsquo;s first whisper rose and went away.

    <p>
      &lsquo;Ohe, Ahmed Din! Shafiz Ullah ahoo! Bahadur Khan, where are you? Come out
      of the tents, as I have done, and fight against the English. Don&rsquo;t kill
      your own kin! Come out to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The deserter from a native corps was crawling round the outskirts of the
      camp, firing at intervals, and shouting invitations to his old comrades.
      Misled by the rain and the darkness, he came to the English wing of the
      camp, and with his yelping and rifle-practice disturbed the men. They had
      been making roads all day, and were tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris was sleeping at Learoyd&rsquo;s feet. &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s all that?&rsquo; he said
      thickly. Learoyd snored, and a Snider bullet ripped its way through the
      tent wall. The men swore. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s that bloomin&rsquo; deserter from the
      Aurangabadis,&rsquo; said Ortheris. &lsquo;Git up, some one, an&rsquo; tell &lsquo;im &lsquo;e&rsquo;s come to
      the wrong shop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to sleep, little man,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, who was steaming nearest the
      door. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t arise an&rsquo; expaytiate with him. &lsquo;Tis rainin&rsquo; entrenchin&rsquo; 
      tools outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t because you bloomin&rsquo; can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause you bloomin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t, ye
      long, limp, lousy, lazy beggar, you. &lsquo;Ark to&rsquo;im &lsquo;owlin&rsquo;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the good of argifying? Put a bullet into the swine! &lsquo;E&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; us
      awake!&rsquo; said another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subaltern shouted angrily, and a dripping sentry whined from the
      darkness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no good, sir. I can&rsquo;t see &lsquo;im. &lsquo;E&rsquo;s &lsquo;idin&rsquo; somewhere down &lsquo;ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris tumbled out of his blanket. &lsquo;Shall I try to get &lsquo;im, sir?&rsquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;Lie down. I won&rsquo;t have the whole camp shooting all
      round the clock. Tell him to go and pot his friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris considered for a moment. Then, putting his head under the tent
      wall, he called, as a &lsquo;bus conductor calls in a block, &lsquo;&rsquo;Igher up, there!
      &lsquo;Igher up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men laughed, and the laughter was carried down wind to the deserter,
      who, hearing that he had made a mistake, went off to worry his own
      regiment half a mile away. He was received with shots; the Aurangabadis
      were very angry with him for disgracing their colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Ortheris, withdrawing his head as he heard
      the hiccough of the Sniders in the distance. &lsquo;S&rsquo;elp me Gawd, tho&rsquo;, that
      man&rsquo;s not fit to live&mdash;messin&rsquo; with my beauty-sleep this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go out and shoot him in the morning, then,&rsquo; said the subaltern
      incautiously. &lsquo;Silence in the tents now. Get your rest, men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris lay down with a happy little sigh, and in two minutes there was
      no sound except the rain on the canvas and the all-embracing and elemental
      snoring of Learoyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp lay on a bare ridge of the Himalayas, and for a week had been
      waiting for a flying column to make connection. The nightly rounds of the
      deserter and his friends had become a nuisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the men dried themselves in hot sunshine and cleaned their
      grimy accoutrements. The native regiment was to take its turn of
      road-making that day while the Old Regiment loafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to lay for a shot at that man,&rsquo; said Ortheris, when he had
      finished washing out his rifle. &lsquo;&rsquo;E comes up the watercourse every evenin&rsquo; 
      about five o&rsquo;clock. If we go and lie out on the north &lsquo;ill a bit this
      afternoon we&rsquo;ll get &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a bloodthirsty little mosquito,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, blowing blue
      clouds into the air. &lsquo;But I suppose I will have to come wid you. Fwhere&rsquo;s
      Jock?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gone out with the Mixed Pickles, &lsquo;cause &lsquo;e thinks &lsquo;isself a bloomin&rsquo; 
      marksman,&rsquo; said Ortheris with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;Mixed Pickles&rsquo; were a detachment of picked shots, generally employed
      in clearing spurs of hills when the enemy were too impertinent. This
      taught the young officers how to handle men, and did not do the enemy much
      harm. Mulvaney and Ortheris strolled out of camp, and passed the
      Aurangabadis going to their road-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to sweat to-day,&rsquo; said Ortheris genially. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to get
      your man. You didn&rsquo;t knock &lsquo;im out last night by any chance, any of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. The pig went away mocking us. I had one shot at him,&rsquo; said a private.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s my cousin, and <i>I</i> ought to have cleared our dishonour. But
      good luck to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went cautiously to the north hill, Ortheris leading, because, as he
      explained, &rsquo;this is a long-range show, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got to do it.&rsquo; His was an
      almost passionate devotion to his rifle, which, by barrack-room report, he
      was supposed to kiss every night before turning in. Charges and scuffles
      he held in contempt, and, when they were inevitable, slipped between
      Mulvaney and Learoyd, bidding them to fight for his skin as well as their
      own. They never failed him. He trotted along, questing like a hound on a
      broken trail, through the wood of the north hill. At last he was
      satisfied, and threw himself down on the soft pine-needled slope that
      commanded a clear view of the watercourse and a brown, bare hillside
      beyond it. The trees made a scented darkness in which an army corps could
      have hidden from the sun-glare without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s the tail o&rsquo; the wood,&rsquo; said Ortheris. &lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got to come up the
      watercourse, &lsquo;cause it gives &lsquo;im cover. We&rsquo;ll lay &lsquo;ere. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t not arf so
      bloomin&rsquo; dusty neither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He buried his nose in a clump of scentless white violets. No one had come
      to tell the flowers that the season of their strength was long past, and
      they had bloomed merrily in the twilight of the pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is something like,&rsquo; he said luxuriously. &lsquo;Wot a &lsquo;evinly clear drop
      for a bullet acrost! How much d&rsquo;you make it, Mulvaney?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seven hunder. Maybe a trifle less, bekaze the air&rsquo;s so thin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      WOP! WOP! WOP! went a volley of musketry on the rear face of the north
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse them Mixed Pickles firin&rsquo; at nothin&rsquo;! They&rsquo;ll scare arf the
      country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thry a sightin&rsquo; shot in the middle of the row,&rsquo; said Mulvaney, the man of
      many wiles. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a red rock yonder he&rsquo;ll be sure to pass. Quick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris ran his sight up to six hundred yards and fired. The bullet threw
      up a feather of dust by a clump of gentians at the base of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good enough!&rsquo; said Ortheris, snapping the scale down. &lsquo;You snick your
      sights to mine or a little lower. You&rsquo;re always firin&rsquo; high. But remember,
      first shot to me. O Lordy! but it&rsquo;s a lovely afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the firing grew louder, and there was a tramping of men in
      the wood. The two lay very quiet, for they knew that the British soldier
      is desperately prone to fire at anything that moves or calls. Then Learoyd
      appeared, his tunic ripped across the breast by a bullet, looking ashamed
      of himself. He flung down on the pine-needles, breathing in snorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One o&rsquo; them damned gardeners o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Pickles,&rsquo; said he, fingering the
      rent. &lsquo;Firin&rsquo; to th&rsquo; right flank, when he knowed I was there. If I knew
      who he was I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; rippen the hide offan him. Look at ma tunic!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the spishil trustability av a marksman. Train him to hit a fly wid
      a stiddy rest at seven hunder, an&rsquo; he loose on anythin&rsquo; he sees or hears
      up to th&rsquo; mile. You&rsquo;re well out av that fancy-firin&rsquo; gang, Jock. Stay
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bin firin&rsquo; at the bloomin&rsquo; wind in the bloomin&rsquo; tree-tops,&rsquo; said Ortheris
      with a chuckle. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you some firin&rsquo; later on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They wallowed in the pine-needles, and the sun warmed them where they lay.
      The Mixed Pickles ceased firing, and returned to camp, and left the wood
      to a few scared apes. The watercourse lifted up its voice in the silence,
      and talked foolishly to the rocks. Now and again the dull thump of a
      blasting charge three miles away told that the Aurangabadis were in
      difficulties with their road-making. The men smiled as they listened and
      lay still, soaking in the warm leisure. Presently Learoyd, between the
      whiffs of his pipe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seems queer&mdash;about &lsquo;im yonder&mdash;desertin&rsquo; at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll be a bloomin&rsquo; side queerer when I&rsquo;ve done with &lsquo;im,&rsquo; said Ortheris.
      They were talking in whispers, for the stillness of the wood and the
      desire of slaughter lay heavy upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I make no doubt he had his reasons for desertin&rsquo;; but, my faith! I make
      less doubt ivry man has good reason for killin&rsquo; him,&rsquo; said Mulvaney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happen there was a lass tewed up wi&rsquo; it. Men do more than more for th&rsquo; 
      sake of a lass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They make most av us &lsquo;list. They&rsquo;ve no manner av right to make us
      desert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah; they make us &lsquo;list, or their fathers do,&rsquo; said Learoyd softly, his
      helmet over his eyes. Ortheris&rsquo;s brows contracted savagely. He was
      watching the valley. &lsquo;If it&rsquo;s a girl I&rsquo;ll shoot the beggar twice over, an&rsquo; 
      second time for bein&rsquo; a fool. You&rsquo;re blasted sentimental all of a sudden.
      Thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; your last near shave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, lad; ah was but thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; what had happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; fwhat has happened, ye lumberin&rsquo; child av calamity, that you&rsquo;re
      lowing like a cow-calf at the back av the pasture, an&rsquo; suggestin&rsquo; 
      invidious excuses for the man Stanley&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to kill. Ye&rsquo;ll have to wait
      another hour yet, little man. Spit it out, Jock, an&rsquo; bellow melojus to the
      moon. It takes an earthquake or a bullet graze to fetch aught out av you.
      Discourse, Don Juan! The a-moors av Lotharius Learoyd! Stanley, kape a
      rowlin&rsquo; rig&rsquo;mental eye on the valley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s along o&rsquo; yon hill there,&rsquo; said Learoyd, watching the bare
      sub-Himalayan spur that reminded him of his Yorkshire moors. He was
      speaking more to himself than his fellows. &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;Rumbolds Moor
      stands up ower Skipton town, an&rsquo; Greenhow Hill stands up ower Pately Brig.
      I reckon you&rsquo;ve never heeard tell o&rsquo; Greenhow Hill, but you bit o&rsquo; bare
      stuff if there was nobbut a white road windin&rsquo; is like ut; strangely like.
      Moors an&rsquo; moors an&rsquo; moors, wi&rsquo; never a tree for shelter, an&rsquo; gray houses
      wi&rsquo; flagstone rooves, and pewits cryin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a windhover goin&rsquo; to and fro
      just like these kites. And cold! A wind that cuts you like a knife. You
      could tell Greenhow Hill folk by the red-apple colour o&rsquo; their cheeks an&rsquo; 
      nose tips, and their blue eyes, driven into pinpoints by the wind. Miners
      mostly, burrowin&rsquo; for lead i&rsquo; th&rsquo; hillsides, followin&rsquo; the trail of th&rsquo; 
      ore vein same as a field-rat. It was the roughest minin&rsquo; I ever seen. Yo&rsquo;d
      come on a bit o&rsquo; creakin&rsquo; wood windlass like a well-head, an&rsquo; you was let
      down i&rsquo; th&rsquo; bight of a rope, fendin&rsquo; yoursen off the side wi&rsquo; one hand,
      carryin&rsquo; a candle stuck in a lump o&rsquo; clay with t&rsquo;other, an&rsquo; clickin&rsquo; hold
      of a rope with t&rsquo;other hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s three of them,&rsquo; said Mulvaney. &lsquo;Must be a good climate in
      those parts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Learoyd took no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; then yo&rsquo; came to a level, where you crept on your hands and knees
      through a mile o&rsquo; windin&rsquo; drift, an&rsquo; you come out into a cave-place as big
      as Leeds Townhall, with a engine pumpin&rsquo; water from workin&rsquo;s &lsquo;at went
      deeper still. It&rsquo;s a queer country, let alone minin&rsquo;, for the hill is full
      of those natural caves, an&rsquo; the rivers an&rsquo; the becks drops into what they
      call pot-holes, an&rsquo; come out again miles away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot was you doin&rsquo; there?&rsquo; said Ortheris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was a young chap then, an&rsquo; mostly went wi&rsquo; &lsquo;osses, leadin&rsquo; coal and
      lead ore; but at th&rsquo; time I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; on I was drivin&rsquo; the waggon-team i&rsquo; 
      th&rsquo; big sumph. I didn&rsquo;t belong to that country-side by rights. I went
      there because of a little difference at home, an&rsquo; at fust I took up wi&rsquo; a
      rough lot. One night we&rsquo;d been drinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I must ha&rsquo; hed more than I
      could stand, or happen th&rsquo; ale was none so good. Though i&rsquo; them days, By
      for God, I never seed bad ale.&rsquo; He flung his arms over his head, and
      gripped a vast handful of white violets. &lsquo;Nah,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I never seed the
      ale I could not drink, the bacca I could not smoke, nor the lass I could
      not kiss. Well, we mun have a race home, the lot on us. I lost all th&rsquo; 
      others, an&rsquo; when I was climbin&rsquo; ower one of them walls built o&rsquo; loose
      stones, I comes down into the ditch, stones and all, an&rsquo; broke my arm. Not
      as I knawed much about it, for I fell on th&rsquo; back of my head, an&rsquo; was
      knocked stupid like. An&rsquo; when I come to mysen it were mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I were
      lyin&rsquo; on the settle i&rsquo; Jesse Roantree&rsquo;s houseplace, an&rsquo; &lsquo;Liza Roantree was
      settin&rsquo; sewin&rsquo;, I ached all ovver, and my mouth were like a lime-kiln. She
      gave me a drink out of a china mug wi&rsquo; gold letters&mdash;&ldquo;A Present from
      Leeds&rdquo;&mdash;as I looked at many and many a time at after. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re to lie
      still while Dr. Warbottom comes, because your arm&rsquo;s broken, and father has
      sent a lad to fetch him. He found yo&rsquo; when he was goin&rsquo; to work, an&rsquo; 
      carried you here on his back,&rdquo; sez she. &ldquo;Oa!&rdquo; sez I; an&rsquo; I shet my eyes,
      for I felt ashamed o&rsquo; mysen. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s gone to his work these three hours,
      an&rsquo; he said he&rsquo;d tell &lsquo;em to get somebody to drive the tram.&rdquo; The clock
      ticked, an&rsquo; a bee comed in the house, an&rsquo; they rung i&rsquo; my head like
      mill-wheels. An&rsquo; she give me another drink an&rsquo; settled the pillow. &ldquo;Eh,
      but yo&rsquo;re young to be getten drunk an&rsquo; such like, but yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t do it
      again, will yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if she&rsquo;d not but stop
      they mill-wheels clatterin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Faith, it&rsquo;s a good thing to be nursed by a woman when you&rsquo;re sick!&rsquo; said
      Mulvaney. &lsquo;Dir&rsquo; cheap at the price av twenty broken heads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris turned to frown across the valley. He had not been nursed by many
      women in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; then Dr. Warbottom comes ridin&rsquo; up, an&rsquo; Jesse Roantree along with
      &lsquo;im. He was a high-larned doctor, but he talked wi&rsquo; poor folk same as
      theirsens. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s ta big agaate on naa?&rdquo; he sings out. &ldquo;Brekkin&rsquo; tha
      thick head?&rdquo; An&rsquo; he felt me all ovver. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s none broken. Tha&rsquo; nobbut
      knocked a bit sillier than ordinary, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s daaft eneaf.&rdquo; An&rsquo; soa he
      went on, callin&rsquo; me all the names he could think on, but settin&rsquo; my arm,
      wi&rsquo; Jesse&rsquo;s help, as careful as could be. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; mun let the big oaf bide
      here a bit, Jesse,&rdquo; he says, when he hed strapped me up an&rsquo; given me a
      dose o&rsquo; physic; &ldquo;an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; Liza will tend him, though he&rsquo;s scarcelins
      worth the trouble. An&rsquo; tha&rsquo;ll lose tha work,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;an&rsquo; tha&rsquo;ll be upon
      th&rsquo; Sick Club for a couple o&rsquo; months an&rsquo; more. Doesn&rsquo;t tha think tha&rsquo;s a
      fool?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But whin was a young man, high or low, the other av a fool, I&rsquo;d like to
      know?&rsquo; said Mulvaney. &lsquo;Sure, folly&rsquo;s the only safe way to wisdom, for I&rsquo;ve
      thried it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wisdom!&rsquo; grinned Ortheris, scanning his comrades with uplifted chin.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re bloomin&rsquo; Solomons, you two, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Learoyd went calmly on, with a steady eye like an ox chewing the cud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that was how I come to know &lsquo;Liza Roantree. There&rsquo;s some tunes as she
      used to sing&mdash;aw, she were always singin&rsquo;&mdash;that fetches Greenhow
      Hill before my eyes as fair as yon brow across there. And she would learn
      me to sing bass, an&rsquo; I was to go to th&rsquo; chapel wi&rsquo; &lsquo;em where Jesse and she
      led the singin&rsquo;, th&rsquo; old man playin&rsquo; the fiddle. He was a strange chap,
      old Jesse, fair mad wi&rsquo; music, an&rsquo; he made me promise to learn the big
      fiddle when my arm was better. It belonged to him, and it stood up in a
      big case alongside o&rsquo; th&rsquo; eight-day clock, but Willie Satterthwaite, as
      played it in the chapel, had getten deaf as a door-post, and it vexed
      Jesse, as he had to rap him ower his head wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; fiddle-stick to make him
      give ower sawin&rsquo; at th&rsquo; right time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there was a black drop in it all, an&rsquo; it was a man in a black coat
      that brought it. When th&rsquo; Primitive Methodist preacher came to Greenhow,
      he would always stop wi&rsquo; Jesse Roantree, an&rsquo; he laid hold of me from th&rsquo; 
      beginning. It seemed I wor a soul to be saved, and he meaned to do it. At
      th&rsquo; same time I jealoused &lsquo;at he were keen o&rsquo; savin&rsquo; &lsquo;Liza Roantree&rsquo;s soul
      as well, and I could ha&rsquo; killed him many a time. An&rsquo; this went on till one
      day I broke out, an&rsquo; borrowed th&rsquo; brass for a drink from &lsquo;Liza. After
      fower days I come back, wi&rsquo; my tail between my legs, just to see &lsquo;Liza
      again. But Jesse were at home an&rsquo; th&rsquo; preacher&mdash;th&rsquo; Reverend Amos
      Barraclough. &lsquo;Liza said naught, but a bit o&rsquo; red come into her face as
      were white of a regular thing. Says Jesse, tryin&rsquo; his best to be civil,
      &ldquo;Nay, lad, it&rsquo;s like this. You&rsquo;ve getten to choose which way it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      be. I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; nobody across ma doorstep as goes a-drinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; borrows my
      lass&rsquo;s money to spend i&rsquo; their drink. Ho&rsquo;d tha tongue, &lsquo;Liza,&rdquo; sez he,
      when she wanted to put in a word &lsquo;at I were welcome to th&rsquo; brass, and she
      were none afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t pay it back. Then the Reverend cuts in,
      seein&rsquo; as Jesse were losin&rsquo; his temper, an&rsquo; they fair beat me among them.
      But it were &lsquo;Liza, as looked an&rsquo; said naught, as did more than either o&rsquo; 
      their tongues, an&rsquo; soa I concluded to get converted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fwhat?&rsquo; shouted Mulvaney. Then, checking himself, he said softly, &lsquo;Let
      be! Let be! Sure the Blessed Virgin is the mother of all religion an&rsquo; most
      women; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a dale av piety in a girl if the men would only let ut
      stay there. I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been converted myself under the circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, but,&rsquo; pursued Learoyd with a blush, &lsquo;I meaned it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris laughed as loudly as he dared, having regard to his business at
      the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, Ortheris, you may laugh, but you didn&rsquo;t know yon preacher Barraclough&mdash;a
      little white-faced chap, wi&rsquo; a voice as &lsquo;ud wile a bird off an a bush, and
      a way o&rsquo; layin&rsquo; hold of folks as made them think they&rsquo;d never had a live
      man for a friend before. You never saw him, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;you never
      seed &lsquo;Liza Roantree&mdash;never seed &lsquo;Liza Roantree.... Happen it was as
      much &lsquo;Liza as th&rsquo; preacher and her father, but anyways they all meaned it,
      an&rsquo; I was fair shamed o&rsquo; mysen, an&rsquo; so I become what they call a changed
      character. And when I think on, it&rsquo;s hard to believe as yon chap going to
      prayer-meetin&rsquo;s, chapel, and class-meetin&rsquo;s were me. But I never had
      naught to say for mysen, though there was a deal o&rsquo; shoutin&rsquo;, and old
      Sammy Strother, as were almost clemmed to death and doubled up with the
      rheumatics, would sing out, &ldquo;Joyful! Joyful!&rdquo; and &lsquo;at it were better to go
      up to heaven in a coal-basket than down to hell i&rsquo; a coach an&rsquo; six. And he
      would put his poor old claw on my shoulder, sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t tha feel it,
      tha great lump? Doesn&rsquo;t tha feel it?&rdquo; An&rsquo; sometimes I thought I did, and
      then again I thought I didn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; how was that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The iverlastin&rsquo; nature av mankind,&rsquo; said Mulvaney. &lsquo;An&rsquo;, furthermore, I
      misdoubt you were built for the Primitive Methodians. They&rsquo;re a new corps
      anyways. I hold by the Ould Church, for she&rsquo;s the mother of them all&mdash;ay,
      an&rsquo; the father, too. I like her bekaze she&rsquo;s most remarkable regimental in
      her fittings. I may die in Honolulu, Nova Zambra, or Cape Cayenne, but
      wherever I die, me bein&rsquo; fwhat I am, an&rsquo; a priest handy, I go under the
      same orders an&rsquo; the same words an&rsquo; the same unction as tho&rsquo; the Pope
      himself come down from the roof av St. Peter&rsquo;s to see me off. There&rsquo;s
      neither high nor low, nor broad nor deep, nor betwixt nor between wid her,
      an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what I like. But mark you, she&rsquo;s no manner av Church for a wake
      man, bekaze she takes the body and the soul av him, onless he has his
      proper work to do. I remember when my father died that was three months
      comin&rsquo; to his grave; begad he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; sold the shebeen above our heads for
      ten minutes&rsquo; quittance of purgathory. An&rsquo; he did all he could. That&rsquo;s why
      I say ut takes a strong man to deal with the Ould Church, an&rsquo; for that
      reason you&rsquo;ll find so many women go there. An&rsquo; that same&rsquo;s a conundrum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; worritin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout these things?&rsquo; said Ortheris. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      bound to find all out quicker nor you want to, any&rsquo;ow.&rsquo; He jerked the
      cartridge out of the breech-block into the palm of his hand. &lsquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s my
      chaplain,&rsquo; he said, and made the venomous black-headed bullet bow like a
      marionette. &lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to teach a man all about which is which, an&rsquo; wot&rsquo;s
      true, after all, before sundown. But wot &lsquo;appened after that, Jock?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was one thing they boggled at, and almost shut th&rsquo; gate i&rsquo; my face
      for, and that were my dog Blast, th&rsquo; only one saved out o&rsquo; a litter o&rsquo; 
      pups as was blowed up when a keg o&rsquo; minin&rsquo; powder loosed off in th&rsquo; 
      store-keeper&rsquo;s hut. They liked his name no better than his business, which
      were fightin&rsquo; every dog he comed across; a rare good dog, wi&rsquo; spots o&rsquo; 
      black and pink on his face, one ear gone, and lame o&rsquo; one side wi&rsquo; being
      driven in a basket through an iron roof, a matter of half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They said I mun give him up &lsquo;cause he were worldly and low; and would I
      let mysen be shut out of heaven for the sake on a dog? &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if
      th&rsquo; door isn&rsquo;t wide enough for th&rsquo; pair on us, we&rsquo;ll stop outside, for
      we&rsquo;ll none be parted.&rdquo; And th&rsquo; preacher spoke up for Blast, as had a
      likin&rsquo; for him from th&rsquo; first&mdash;I reckon that was why I come to like
      th&rsquo; preacher&mdash;and wouldn&rsquo;t hear o&rsquo; changin&rsquo; his name to Bless, as
      some o&rsquo; them wanted. So th&rsquo; pair on us became reg&rsquo;lar chapel-members. But
      it&rsquo;s hard for a young chap o&rsquo; my build to cut traces from the world, th&rsquo; 
      flesh, an&rsquo; the devil all uv a heap. Yet I stuck to it for a long time,
      while th&rsquo; lads as used to stand about th&rsquo; town-end an&rsquo; lean ower th&rsquo; 
      bridge, spittin&rsquo; into th&rsquo; beck o&rsquo; a Sunday, would call after me, &ldquo;Sitha,
      Learoyd, when&rsquo;s ta bean to preach, &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; to hear tha.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ho&rsquo;d
      tha jaw. He hasn&rsquo;t getten th&rsquo; white choaker on ta morn,&rdquo; another lad would
      say, and I had to double my fists hard i&rsquo; th&rsquo; bottom of my Sunday coat,
      and say to mysen, &ldquo;If &lsquo;twere Monday and I warn&rsquo;t a member o&rsquo; the Primitive
      Methodists, I&rsquo;d leather all th&rsquo; lot of yond&rsquo;.&rdquo; That was th&rsquo; hardest of all&mdash;to
      know that I could fight and I mustn&rsquo;t fight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sympathetic grunts from Mulvaney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So what wi&rsquo; singin&rsquo;, practising and class-meetin&rsquo;s, and th&rsquo; big fiddle,
      as he made me take between my knees, I spent a deal o&rsquo; time i&rsquo; Jesse
      Roantree&rsquo;s house-place. But often as I was there, th&rsquo; preacher fared to me
      to go oftener, and both th&rsquo; old man an&rsquo; th&rsquo; young woman were pleased to
      have him. He lived i&rsquo; Pately Brig, as were a goodish step off, but he
      come. He come all the same. I liked him as well or better as any man I&rsquo;d
      ever seen i&rsquo; one way, and yet I hated him wi&rsquo; all my heart i&rsquo; t&rsquo;other, and
      we watched each other like cat and mouse, but civil as you please, for I
      was on my best behaviour, and he was that fair and open that I was bound
      to be fair with him. Rare good company he was, if I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to wring
      his cliver little neck half of the time. Often and often when he was goin&rsquo; 
      from Jesse&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d set him a bit on the road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See &lsquo;im &lsquo;ome, you mean?&rsquo; said Ortheris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay. It&rsquo;s a way we have i&rsquo; Yorkshire o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; friends off. You was a
      friend as I didn&rsquo;t want to come back, and he didn&rsquo;t want me to come back
      neither, and so we&rsquo;d walk together towards Pately, and then he&rsquo;d set me
      back again, and there we&rsquo;d be wal two o&rsquo;clock i&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; settin&rsquo; each
      other to an&rsquo; fro like a blasted pair o&rsquo; pendulums twixt hill and valley,
      long after th&rsquo; light had gone out i&rsquo; &lsquo;Liza&rsquo;s window, as both on us had
      been looking at, pretending to watch the moon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; broke in Mulvaney, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;d no chanst against the maraudin&rsquo; 
      psalm-singer. They&rsquo;ll take the airs an&rsquo; the graces instid av the man nine
      times out av ten, an&rsquo; they only find the blunder later&mdash;the wimmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just where yo&rsquo;re wrong,&rsquo; said Learoyd, reddening under the
      freckled tan of his cheeks. &lsquo;I was th&rsquo; first wi&rsquo; &lsquo;Liza, an&rsquo; yo&rsquo;d think
      that were enough. But th&rsquo; parson were a steady-gaited sort o&rsquo; chap, and
      Jesse were strong o&rsquo; his side, and all th&rsquo; women i&rsquo; the congregation
      dinned it to &lsquo;Liza &lsquo;at she were fair fond to take up wi&rsquo; a wastrel
      ne&rsquo;er-do-weel like me, as was scarcelins respectable an&rsquo; a fighting dog at
      his heels. It was all very well for her to be doing me good and saving my
      soul, but she must mind as she didn&rsquo;t do herself harm. They talk o&rsquo; rich
      folk bein&rsquo; stuck up an&rsquo; genteel, but for cast-iron pride o&rsquo; respectability
      there&rsquo;s naught like poor chapel folk. It&rsquo;s as cold as th&rsquo; wind o&rsquo; Greenhow
      Hill&mdash;ay, and colder, for &lsquo;twill never change. And now I come to
      think on it, one at strangest things I know is &lsquo;at they couldn&rsquo;t abide th&rsquo; 
      thought o&rsquo; soldiering. There&rsquo;s a vast o&rsquo; fightin&rsquo; i&rsquo; th&rsquo; Bible, and
      there&rsquo;s a deal of Methodists i&rsquo; th&rsquo; army; but to hear chapel folk talk
      yo&rsquo;d think that soldierin&rsquo; were next door, an&rsquo; t&rsquo;other side, to hangin&rsquo;.
      I&rsquo; their meetin&rsquo;s all their talk is o&rsquo; fightin&rsquo;. When Sammy Strother were
      stuck for summat to say in his prayers, he&rsquo;d sing out, &ldquo;Th&rsquo; sword o&rsquo; th&rsquo; 
      Lord and o&rsquo; Gideon.&rdquo; They were allus at it about puttin&rsquo; on th&rsquo; whole
      armour o&rsquo; righteousness, an&rsquo; fightin&rsquo; the good fight o&rsquo; faith. And then,
      atop o&rsquo; &lsquo;t all, they held a prayer-meetin&rsquo; ower a young chap as wanted to
      &lsquo;list, and nearly deafened him, till he picked up his hat and fair ran
      away. And they&rsquo;d tell tales in th&rsquo; Sunday-school o&rsquo; bad lads as had been
      thumped and brayed for bird-nesting o&rsquo; Sundays and playin&rsquo; truant o&rsquo; 
      week-days, and how they took to wrestlin&rsquo;, dog-fightin&rsquo;, rabbit-runnin&rsquo;,
      and drinkin&rsquo;, till at last, as if &lsquo;twere a hepitaph on a gravestone, they
      damned him across th&rsquo; moors wi&rsquo;, &ldquo;an&rsquo; then he went and &lsquo;listed for a
      soldier,&rdquo; an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d all fetch a deep breath, and throw up their eyes like
      a hen drinkin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fwhy is ut?&rsquo; said Mulvaney, bringing down his hand on his thigh with a
      crack.&rsquo; In the name av God, fwhy is ut? I&rsquo;ve seen ut, tu. They cheat an&rsquo; 
      they swindle an&rsquo; they lie an&rsquo; they slander, an&rsquo; fifty things fifty times
      worse; but the last an&rsquo; the worst by their reckonin&rsquo; is to serve the Widdy
      honest. It&rsquo;s like the talk av childher&mdash;seein&rsquo; things all round.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plucky lot of fightin&rsquo; good fights of whatsername they&rsquo;d do if we didn&rsquo;t
      see they had a quiet place to fight in. And such fightin&rsquo; as theirs is!
      Cats on the tiles. T&rsquo;other callin&rsquo; to which to come on. I&rsquo;d give a month&rsquo;s
      pay to get some o&rsquo; them broad-backed beggars in London sweatin&rsquo; through a
      day&rsquo;s road-makin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a night&rsquo;s rain. They&rsquo;d carry on a deal afterwards&mdash;same
      as we&rsquo;re supposed to carry on. I&rsquo;ve bin turned out of a measly arf-license
      pub down Lambeth way, full o&rsquo; greasy kebmen, &lsquo;fore now,&rsquo; said Ortheris
      with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe you were dhrunk,&rsquo; said Mulvaney soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse nor that. The Forders were drunk. <i>I</i> was wearin&rsquo; the Queen&rsquo;s
      uniform.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d no particular thought to be a soldier i&rsquo; them days,&rsquo; said Learoyd,
      still keeping his eye on the bare hill opposite, &lsquo;but this sort o&rsquo; talk
      put it i&rsquo; my head. They was so good, th&rsquo; chapel folk, that they tumbled
      ower t&rsquo;other side. But I stuck to it for &lsquo;Liza&rsquo;s sake, specially as she
      was learning me to sing the bass part in a horotorio as Jesse were gettin&rsquo; 
      up. She sung like a throstle hersen, and we had practisin&rsquo;s night after
      night for a matter of three months.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what a horotorio is,&rsquo; said Ortheris pertly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of
      chaplain&rsquo;s sing-song&mdash;words all out of the Bible, and hullabaloojah
      choruses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most Greenhow Hill folks played some instrument or t&rsquo;other, an&rsquo; they all
      sung so you might have heard them miles away, and they were so pleased wi&rsquo; 
      the noise they made they didn&rsquo;t fair to want anybody to listen. The
      preacher sung high seconds when he wasn&rsquo;t playin&rsquo; the flute, an&rsquo; they set
      me, as hadn&rsquo;t got far with big fiddle, again Willie Satterthwaite, to jog
      his elbow when he had to get a&rsquo; gate playin&rsquo;. Old Jesse was happy if ever
      a man was, for he were th&rsquo; conductor an&rsquo; th&rsquo; first fiddle an&rsquo; th&rsquo; leadin&rsquo; 
      singer, beatin&rsquo; time wi&rsquo; his fiddle-stick, till at times he&rsquo;d rap with it
      on the table, and cry out, &ldquo;Now, you mun all stop; it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;d
      face round to his front, fair sweating wi&rsquo; pride, to sing th&rsquo; tenor solos.
      But he were grandest i&rsquo; th&rsquo; choruses, waggin&rsquo; his head, flinging his arms
      round like a windmill, and singin&rsquo; hisself black in the face. A rare
      singer were Jesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo&rsquo; see, I was not o&rsquo; much account wi&rsquo; &lsquo;em all exceptin&rsquo; to &lsquo;Liza
      Roantree, and I had a deal o&rsquo; time settin&rsquo; quiet at meetings and horotorio
      practises to hearken their talk, and if it were strange to me at
      beginnin&rsquo;, it got stranger still at after, when I was shut on it, and
      could study what it meaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just after th&rsquo; horotorios come off, &lsquo;Liza, as had allus been weakly like,
      was took very bad. I walked Dr. Warbottom&rsquo;s horse up and down a deal of
      times while he were inside, where they wouldn&rsquo;t let me go, though I fair
      ached to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be better i&rsquo; noo, lad&mdash;better i&rsquo; noo,&rdquo; he used to say. &ldquo;Tha
      mun ha&rsquo; patience.&rdquo; Then they said if I was quiet I might go in, and th&rsquo; 
      Reverend Amos Barraclough used to read to her lyin&rsquo; propped up among th&rsquo; 
      pillows. Then she began to mend a bit, and they let me carry her on to th&rsquo; 
      settle, and when it got warm again she went about same as afore. Th&rsquo; 
      preacher and me and Blast was a deal together i&rsquo; them days, and i&rsquo; one way
      we was rare good comrades. But I could ha&rsquo; stretched him time and again
      with a good will. I mind one day he said he would like to go down into th&rsquo; 
      bowels o&rsquo; th&rsquo; earth, and see how th&rsquo; Lord had builded th&rsquo; framework o&rsquo; th&rsquo; 
      everlastin&rsquo; hills. He were one of them chaps as had a gift o&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; 
      things. They rolled off the tip of his clever tongue, same as Mulvaney
      here, as would ha&rsquo; made a rare good preacher if he had nobbut given his
      mind to it. I lent him a suit o&rsquo; miner&rsquo;s kit as almost buried th&rsquo; little
      man, and his white face down i&rsquo; th&rsquo; coat-collar and hat-flap looked like
      the face of a boggart, and he cowered down i&rsquo; th&rsquo; bottom o&rsquo; the waggon. I
      was drivin&rsquo; a tram as led up a bit of an incline up to th&rsquo; cave where the
      engine was pumpin&rsquo;, and where th&rsquo; ore was brought up and put into th&rsquo; 
      waggons as went down o&rsquo; themselves, me puttin&rsquo; th&rsquo; brake on and th&rsquo; horses
      a-trottin&rsquo; after. Long as it was daylight we were good friends, but when
      we got fair into th&rsquo; dark, and could nobbut see th&rsquo; day shinin&rsquo; at the
      hole like a lamp at a street-end, I feeled downright wicked. Ma religion
      dropped all away from me when I looked back at him as were always comin&rsquo; 
      between me and &lsquo;Liza. The talk was &lsquo;at they were to be wed when she got
      better, an&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t get her to say yes or nay to it. He began to sing a
      hymn in his thin voice, and I came out wi&rsquo; a chorus that was all cussin&rsquo; 
      an&rsquo; swearin&rsquo; at my horses, an&rsquo; I began to know how I hated him. He were
      such a little chap, too. I could drop him wi&rsquo; one hand down Garstang&rsquo;s
      Copper-hole&mdash;a place where th&rsquo; beck slithered ower th&rsquo; edge on a
      rock, and fell wi&rsquo; a bit of a whisper into a pit as no rope i&rsquo; Greenhow
      could plump.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Learoyd rooted up the innocent violets. &lsquo;Ay, he should see th&rsquo; 
      bowels o&rsquo; th&rsquo; earth an&rsquo; never naught else. I could take him a mile or two
      along th&rsquo; drift, and leave him wi&rsquo; his candle doused to cry hallelujah,
      wi&rsquo; none to hear him and say amen. I was to lead him down th&rsquo; ladder-way
      to th&rsquo; drift where Jesse Roantree was workin&rsquo;, and why shouldn&rsquo;t he slip
      on th&rsquo; ladder, wi&rsquo; my feet on his fingers till they loosed grip, and I put
      him down wi&rsquo; my heel? If I went fust down th&rsquo; ladder I could click hold on
      him and chuck him over my head, so as he should go squshin&rsquo; down the
      shaft, breakin&rsquo; his bones at ev&rsquo;ry timberin&rsquo; as Bill Appleton did when he
      was fresh, and hadn&rsquo;t a bone left when he wrought to th&rsquo; bottom. Niver a
      blasted leg to walk from Pately. Niver an arm to put round &lsquo;Liza
      Roantree&rsquo;s waist. Niver no more&mdash;niver no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick lips curled back over the yellow teeth, and that flushed face
      was not pretty to look upon. Mulvaney nodded sympathy, and Ortheris, moved
      by his comrade&rsquo;s passion, brought up the rifle to his shoulder, and
      searched the hillside for his quarry, muttering ribaldry about a sparrow,
      a spout, and a thunder-storm. The voice of the watercourse supplied the
      necessary small talk till Learoyd picked up his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s none so easy to kill a man like you. When I&rsquo;d given up my horses
      to th&rsquo; lad as took my place and I was showin&rsquo; th&rsquo; preacher th&rsquo; workin&rsquo;s,
      shoutin&rsquo; into his ear across th&rsquo; clang o&rsquo; th&rsquo; pumpin&rsquo; engines, I saw he
      were afraid o&rsquo; naught; and when the lamplight showed his black eyes, I
      could feel as he was masterin&rsquo; me again. I were no better nor Blast
      chained up short and growlin&rsquo; i&rsquo; the depths of him while a strange dog
      went safe past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Th&rsquo;art a coward and a fool,&rdquo; I said to mysen; an&rsquo; I wrestled i&rsquo; my mind
      again&rsquo; him till, when we come to Garstang&rsquo;s Copper-hole, I laid hold o&rsquo; 
      the preacher and lifted him up over my head and held him into the darkest
      on it. &ldquo;Now, lad,&rdquo; I says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s to be one or t&rsquo;other on us&mdash;thee or
      me&mdash;for &lsquo;Liza Roantree. Why, isn&rsquo;t thee afraid for thysen?&rdquo; I says,
      for he were still i&rsquo; my arms as a sack. &ldquo;Nay; I&rsquo;m but afraid for thee, my
      poor lad, as knows naught,&rdquo; says he. I set him down on th&rsquo; edge, an&rsquo; th&rsquo; 
      beck run stiller, an&rsquo; there was no more buzzin&rsquo; in my head like when th&rsquo; 
      bee come through th&rsquo; window o&rsquo; Jesse&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;What dost tha mean?&rdquo; says
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought as thou ought to know,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but &lsquo;twas hard to
      tell thee. &lsquo;Liza Roantree&rsquo;s for neither on us, nor for nobody o&rsquo; this
      earth. Dr. Warbottom says&mdash;and he knows her, and her mother before
      her&mdash;that she is in a decline, and she cannot live six months longer.
      He&rsquo;s known it for many a day. Steady, John! Steady!&rdquo; says he. And that
      weak little man pulled me further back and set me again&rsquo; him, and talked
      it all over quiet and still, me turnin&rsquo; a bunch o&rsquo; candles in my hand, and
      counting them ower and ower again as I listened. A deal on it were th&rsquo; 
      regular preachin&rsquo; talk, but there were a vast lot as made me begin to
      think as he were more of a man than I&rsquo;d ever given him credit for, till I
      were cut as deep for him as I were for mysen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Six candles we had, and we crawled and climbed all that day while they
      lasted, and I said to mysen, &ldquo;&lsquo;Liza Roantree hasn&rsquo;t six months to live.&rdquo;
       And when we came into th&rsquo; daylight again we were like dead men to look at,
      an&rsquo; Blast come behind us without so much as waggin&rsquo; his tail. When I saw
      &lsquo;Liza again she looked at me a minute and says, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s telled tha? For I
      see tha knows.&rdquo; And she tried to smile as she kissed me, and I fair broke
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yo&rsquo; see, I was a young chap i&rsquo; them days, and had seen naught o&rsquo; life,
      let alone death, as is allus a-waitin&rsquo;. She telled me as Dr. Warbottom
      said as Greenhow air was too keen, and they were goin&rsquo; to Bradford, to
      Jesse&rsquo;s brother David, as worked i&rsquo; a mill, and I mun hold up like a man
      and a Christian, and she&rsquo;d pray for me. Well, and they went away, and the
      preacher that same back end o&rsquo; th&rsquo; year were appointed to another circuit,
      as they call it, and I were left alone on Greenhow Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tried, and I tried hard, to stick to th&rsquo; chapel, but &lsquo;tweren&rsquo;t th&rsquo; same
      thing at after. I hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Liza&rsquo;s voice to follow i&rsquo; th&rsquo; singin&rsquo;, nor her
      eyes a-shinin&rsquo; acrost their heads. And i&rsquo; th&rsquo; class-meetings they said as
      I mun have some experiences to tell, and I hadn&rsquo;t a word to say for mysen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blast and me moped a good deal, and happen we didn&rsquo;t behave ourselves
      over well, for they dropped us and wondered however they&rsquo;d come to take us
      up. I can&rsquo;t tell how we got through th&rsquo; time, while i&rsquo; th&rsquo; winter I gave
      up my job and went to Bradford. Old Jesse were at th&rsquo; door o&rsquo; th&rsquo; house,
      in a long street o&rsquo; little houses. He&rsquo;d been sendin&rsquo; th&rsquo; children &lsquo;way as
      were clatterin&rsquo; their clogs in th&rsquo; causeway, for she were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is it thee?&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not to see her. I&rsquo;ll none have her
      wakened for a nowt like thee. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; fast, and she mun go in peace.
      Thou&rsquo;lt never be good for naught i&rsquo; th&rsquo; world, and as long as thou lives
      thou&rsquo;ll never play the big fiddle. Get away, lad, get away!&rdquo; So he shut
      the door softly i&rsquo; my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody never made Jesse my master, but it seemed to me he was about
      right, and I went away into the town and knocked up against a recruiting
      sergeant. The old tales o&rsquo; th&rsquo; chapel folk came buzzin&rsquo; into my head. I
      was to get away, and this were th&rsquo; regular road for the likes o&rsquo; me. I
      &lsquo;listed there and then, took th&rsquo; Widow&rsquo;s shillin&rsquo;, and had a bunch o&rsquo; 
      ribbons pinned i&rsquo; my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But next day I found my way to David Roantree&rsquo;s door, and Jesse came to
      open it. Says he, &ldquo;Thou&rsquo;s come back again wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s colours flyin&rsquo;&mdash;thy
      true colours, as I always telled thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I begged and prayed of him to let me see her nobbut to say good-bye,
      till a woman calls down th&rsquo; stairway, &ldquo;She says John Learoyd&rsquo;s to come
      up.&rdquo; Th&rsquo; old man shifts aside in a flash, and lays his hand on my arm,
      quite gentle like. &ldquo;But thou&rsquo;lt be quiet, John,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for she&rsquo;s rare
      and weak. Thou was allus a good lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her eyes were all alive wi&rsquo; light, and her hair was thick on the pillow
      round her, but her cheeks were thin&mdash;thin to frighten a man that&rsquo;s
      strong. &ldquo;Nay, father, yo mayn&rsquo;t say th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s colours. Them ribbons is
      pretty.&rdquo; An&rsquo; she held out her hands for th&rsquo; hat, an&rsquo; she put all straight
      as a woman will wi&rsquo; ribbons. &ldquo;Nay, but what they&rsquo;re pretty,&rdquo; she says.
      &ldquo;Eh, but I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; liked to see thee i&rsquo; thy red coat, John, for thou was
      allus my own lad&mdash;my very own lad, and none else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She lifted up her arms, and they come round my neck i&rsquo; a gentle grip, and
      they slacked away, and she seemed fainting. &ldquo;Now yo&rsquo; mun get away, lad,&rdquo;
       says Jesse, and I picked up my hat and I came downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Th&rsquo; recruiting sergeant were waitin&rsquo; for me at th&rsquo; corner public-house.
      &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;ve seen your sweetheart?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen her,&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have a quart now, and you&rsquo;ll do your best to forget her,&rdquo;
       says he, bein&rsquo; one o&rsquo; them smart, bustlin&rsquo; chaps. &ldquo;Ay, sergeant,&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;Forget her.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;ve been forgettin&rsquo; her ever since.&rsquo;

      He threw away the wilted clump of white violets as he spoke. Ortheris
      suddenly rose to his knees, his rifle at his shoulder, and peered across
      the valley in the clear afternoon light. His chin cuddled the stock, and
      there was a twitching of the muscles of the right cheek as he sighted;
      Private Stanley Ortheris was engaged on his business. A speck of white
      crawled up the watercourse.

      &lsquo;See that beggar? . . . Got &lsquo;im.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven hundred yards away, and a full two hundred down the hillside, the
      deserter of the Aurangabadis pitched forward, rolled down a red rock, and
      lay very still, with his face in a clump of blue gentians, while a big
      raven flapped out of the pine wood to make investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a clean shot, little man,&rsquo; said Mulvaney.

      Learoyd thoughtfully watched the smoke clear away.

    <p>
      &lsquo;Happen there was a lass tewed up wi&rsquo; him, too,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ortheris did not reply. He was staring across the valley, with the smile
      of the artist who looks on the completed work.

 The Earth gave up her dead that tide,

 And said his say, and went his way,
      And left our hearts aflame.

      Let it be clearly understood that the Russian is a delightful person till
      he tucks in his shirt. As an Oriental he is charming. It is only when he
      insists upon being treated as the most easterly of western peoples instead
      of the most westerly of easterns that he becomes a racial anomaly
      extremely difficult to handle. The host never knows which side of his
      nature is going to turn up next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirkovitch was a Russian&mdash;a Russian of the Russians&mdash;who
      appeared to get his bread by serving the Czar as an officer in a Cossack
      regiment, and corresponding for a Russian newspaper with a name that was
      never twice alike. He was a handsome young Oriental, fond of wandering
      through unexplored portions of the earth, and he arrived in India from
      nowhere in particular. At least no living man could ascertain whether it
      was by way of Balkh, Badakshan, Chitral, Beluchistan, or Nepaul, or
      anywhere else. The Indian Government, being in an unusually affable mood,
      gave orders that he was to be civilly treated and shown everything that
      was to be seen. So he drifted, talking bad English and worse French, from
      one city to another, till he foregathered with Her Majesty&rsquo;s White Hussars
      in the city of Peshawur, which stands at the mouth of that narrow swordcut
      in the hills that men call the Khyber Pass. He was undoubtedly an officer,
      and he was decorated after the manner of the Russians with little
      enamelled crosses, and he could talk, and (though this has nothing to do
      with his merits) he had been given up as a hopeless task, or cask, by the
      Black Tyrone, who individually and collectively, with hot whisky and
      honey, mulled brandy, and mixed spirits of every kind, had striven in all
      hospitality to make him drunk. And when the Black Tyrone, who are
      exclusively Irish, fail to disturb the peace of head of a foreigner&mdash;that
      foreigner is certain to be a superior man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Hussars were as conscientious in choosing their wine as in
      charging the enemy. All that they possessed, including some wondrous
      brandy, was placed at the absolute disposition of Dirkovitch, and he
      enjoyed himself hugely&mdash;even more than among the Black Tyrones.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remained distressingly European through it all. The White Hussars
      were &lsquo;My dear true friends,&rsquo; &lsquo;Fellow-soldiers glorious,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Brothers
      inseparable.&rsquo; He would unburden himself by the hour on the glorious future
      that awaited the combined arms of England and Russia when their hearts and
      their territories should run side by side and the great mission of
      civilising Asia should begin. That was unsatisfactory, because Asia is not
      going to be civilised after the methods of the West. There is too much
      Asia and she is too old. You cannot reform a lady of many lovers, and Asia
      has been insatiable in her flirtations aforetime. She will never attend
      Sunday-school or learn to vote save with swords for tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirkovitch knew this as well as any one else, but it suited him to talk
      special-correspondently and to make himself as genial as he could. Now and
      then he volunteered a little, a very little, information about his own
      sotnia of Cossacks, left apparently to look after themselves somewhere at
      the back of beyond. He had done rough work in Central Asia, and had seen
      rather more help-yourself fighting than most men of his years. But he was
      careful never to betray his superiority, and more than careful to praise
      on all occasions the appearance, drill, uniform, and organisation of Her
      Majesty&rsquo;s White Hussars. And indeed they were a regiment to be admired.
      When Lady Durgan, widow of the late Sir John Durgan, arrived in their
      station, and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man
      at mess, she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that
      they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all, including the
      colonel and some majors already married, she was not going to content
      herself with one hussar. Wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle
      regiment, being by nature contradictious; and the White Hussars were going
      to wear crape on their arms, but compromised by attending the wedding in
      full force, and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach. She had jilted
      them all&mdash;from Basset-Holmer the senior captain to little Mildred the
      junior subaltern, who could have given her four thousand a year and a
      title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only persons who did not share the general regard for the White
      Hussars were a few thousand gentlemen of Jewish extraction who lived
      across the border, and answered to the name of Pathan. They had once met
      the regiment officially and for something less than twenty minutes, but
      the interview, which was complicated with many casualties, had filled them
      with prejudice. They even called the White Hussars children of the devil
      and sons of persons whom it would be perfectly impossible to meet in
      decent society. Yet they were not above making their aversion fill their
      money-belts. The regiment possessed carbines&mdash;beautiful Martini-Henri
      carbines that would lob a bullet into an enemy&rsquo;s camp at one thousand
      yards, and were even handier than the long rifle. Therefore they were
      coveted all along the border, and since demand inevitably breeds supply,
      they were supplied at the risk of life and limb for exactly their weight
      in coined silver&mdash;seven and one-half pounds weight of rupees, or
      sixteen pounds sterling reckoning the rupee at par. They were stolen at
      night by snaky-haired thieves who crawled on their stomachs under the nose
      of the sentries; they disappeared mysteriously from locked arm-racks, and
      in the hot weather, when all the barrack doors and windows were open, they
      vanished like puffs of their own smoke. The border people desired them for
      family vendettas and contingencies. But in the long cold nights of the
      northern Indian winter they were stolen most extensively. The traffic of
      murder was liveliest among the hills at that season, and prices ruled
      high. The regimental guards were first doubled and then trebled. A trooper
      does not much care if he loses a weapon&mdash;Government must make it good&mdash;but
      he deeply resents the loss of his sleep. The regiment grew very angry, and
      one rifle-thief bears the visible marks of their anger upon him to this
      hour. That incident stopped the burglaries for a time, and the guards were
      reduced accordingly, and the regiment devoted itself to polo with
      unexpected results; for it beat by two goals to one that very terrible
      polo corps the Lushkar Light Horse, though the latter had four ponies
      apiece for a short hour&rsquo;s fight, as well as a native officer who played
      like a lambent flame across the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave a dinner to celebrate the event. The Lushkar team came, and
      Dirkovitch came, in the fullest full uniform of a Cossack officer, which
      is as full as a dressing-gown, and was introduced to the Lushkars, and
      opened his eyes as he regarded. They were lighter men than the Hussars,
      and they carried themselves with the swing that is the peculiar right of
      the Punjab Frontier Force and all Irregular Horse. Like everything else in
      the Service it has to be learnt, but, unlike many things, it is never
      forgotten, and remains on the body till death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great beam-roofed mess-room of the White Hussars was a sight to be
      remembered. All the mess plate was out on the long table&mdash;the same
      table that had served up the bodies of five officers after a forgotten
      fight long and long ago&mdash;the dingy, battered standards faced the door
      of entrance, clumps of winter-roses lay between the silver candlesticks,
      and the portraits of eminent officers deceased looked down on their
      successors from between the heads of sambhur, nilghai, markhor, and, pride
      of all the mess, two grinning snow-leopards that had cost Basset-Holmer
      four months&rsquo; leave that he might have spent in England, instead of on the
      road to Thibet and the daily risk of his life by ledge, snow-slide, and
      grassy slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants in spotless white muslin and the crest of their regiments on
      the brow of their turbans waited behind their masters, who were clad in
      the scarlet and gold of the White Hussars, and the cream and silver of the
      Lushkar Light Horse. Dirkovitch&rsquo;s dull green uniform was the only dark
      spot at the board, but his big onyx eyes made up for it. He was
      fraternising effusively with the captain of the Lushkar team, who was
      wondering how many of Dirkovitch&rsquo;s Cossacks his own dark wiry
      down-countrymen could account for in a fair charge. But one does not speak
      of these things openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk rose higher and higher, and the regimental band played between
      the courses, as is the immemorial custom, till all tongues ceased for a
      moment with the removal of the dinner-slips and the first toast of
      obligation, when an officer rising said, &lsquo;Mr. Vice, the Queen,&rsquo; and little
      Mildred from the bottom of the table answered, &lsquo;The Queen, God bless her,&rsquo; 
      and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank
      the Queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their
      mess-bills. That Sacrament of the Mess never grows old, and never ceases
      to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever he be by sea or
      by land. Dirkovitch rose with his &lsquo;brothers glorious,&rsquo; but he could not
      understand. No one but an officer can tell what the toast means; and the
      bulk have more sentiment than comprehension. Immediately after the little
      silence that follows on the ceremony there entered the native officer who
      had played for the Lushkar team. He could not, of course, eat with the
      mess, but he came in at dessert, all six feet of him, with the blue and
      silver turban atop, and the big black boots below. The mess rose joyously
      as he thrust forward the hilt of his sabre in token of fealty for the
      colonel of the White Hussars to touch, and dropped into a vacant chair
      amid shouts of: &lsquo;Rung ho, Hira Singh!&rsquo; (which being translated means &lsquo;Go
      in and win&rsquo;). &lsquo;Did I whack you over the knee, old man?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ressaidar Sahib,
      what the devil made you play that kicking pig of a pony in the last ten
      minutes?&rsquo; &lsquo;Shabash, Ressaidar Sahib!&rsquo; Then the voice of the colonel, &lsquo;The
      health of Ressaidar Hira Singh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After the shouting had died away Hira Singh rose to reply, for he was the
      cadet of a royal house, the son of a king&rsquo;s son, and knew what was due on
      these occasions. Thus he spoke in the vernacular:&mdash;&lsquo;Colonel Sahib and
      officers of this regiment. Much honour have you done me. This will I
      remember. We came down from afar to play you. But we were beaten.&rsquo; (&lsquo;No
      fault of yours, Ressaidar Sahib. Played on our own ground y&rsquo;know. Your
      ponies were cramped from the railway. Don&rsquo;t apologise!&rsquo;) &lsquo;Therefore
      perhaps we will come again if it be so ordained.&rsquo; (&lsquo;Hear! Hear! Hear,
      indeed! Bravo! Hsh!&rsquo;) &lsquo;Then we will play you afresh&rsquo; (&lsquo;Happy to meet
      you.&rsquo;) &lsquo;till there are left no feet upon our ponies. Thus far for sport.&rsquo; 
      He dropped one hand on his sword-hilt and his eye wandered to Dirkovitch
      lolling back in his chair. &lsquo;But if by the will of God there arises any
      other game which is not the polo game, then be assured, Colonel Sahib and
      officers, that we will play it out side by side, though THEY,&rsquo; again his
      eye sought Dirkovitch, &lsquo;though THEY I say have fifty ponies to our one
      horse.&rsquo; And with a deep-mouthed Rung ho! that sounded like a musket-butt
      on flagstones he sat down amid leaping glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirkovitch, who had devoted himself steadily to the brandy&mdash;the
      terrible brandy aforementioned&mdash;did not understand, nor did the
      expurgated translations offered to him at all convey the point. Decidedly
      Hira Singh&rsquo;s was the speech of the evening, and the clamour might have
      continued to the dawn had it not been broken by the noise of a shot
      without that sent every man feeling at his defenceless left side. Then
      there was a scuffle and a yell of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Carbine-stealing again!&rsquo; said the adjutant, calmly sinking back in his
      chair. &lsquo;This comes of reducing the guards. I hope the sentries have killed
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The feet of armed men pounded on the verandah flags, and it was as though
      something was being dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t they put him in the cells till the morning?&rsquo; said the colonel
      testily. &lsquo;See if they&rsquo;ve damaged him, sergeant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mess sergeant fled out into the darkness and returned with two
      troopers and a corporal, all very much perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Caught a man stealin&rsquo; carbines, sir,&rsquo; said the corporal. &lsquo;Leastways &lsquo;e
      was crawlin&rsquo; towards the barricks, sir, past the main road sentries, an&rsquo; 
      the sentry &lsquo;e sez, sir&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The limp heap of rags upheld by the three men groaned. Never was seen so
      destitute and demoralised an Afghan. He was turbanless, shoeless, caked
      with dirt, and all but dead with rough handling. Hira Singh started
      slightly at the sound of the man&rsquo;s pain. Dirkovitch took another glass of
      brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WHAT does the sentry say?&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sez &lsquo;e speaks English, sir,&rsquo; said the corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you brought him into mess instead of handing him over to the sergeant!
      If he spoke all the Tongues of the Pentecost you&rsquo;ve no business&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the bundle groaned and muttered. Little Mildred had risen from his
      place to inspect. He jumped back as though he had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it would be better, sir, to send the men away,&rsquo; said he to the
      colonel, for he was a much privileged subaltern. He put his arms round the
      ragbound horror as he spoke, and dropped him into a chair. It may not have
      been explained that the littleness of Mildred lay in his being six feet
      four and big in proportion. The corporal seeing that an officer was
      disposed to look after the capture, and that the colonel&rsquo;s eye was
      beginning to blaze, promptly removed himself and his men. The mess was
      left alone with the carbine-thief, who laid his head on the table and wept
      bitterly, hopelessly, and inconsolably, as little children weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hira Singh leapt to his feet. &lsquo;Colonel Sahib,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that man is no
      Afghan, for they weep Ai! Ai! Nor is he of Hindustan, for they weep Oh!
      Ho! He weeps after the fashion of the white men, who say Ow! Ow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now where the dickens did you get that knowledge, Hira Singh?&rsquo; said the
      captain of the Lushkar team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear him!&rsquo; said Hira Singh simply, pointing at the crumpled figure that
      wept as though it would never cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;&rsquo; said little Mildred. &lsquo;I heard him say it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel and the mess-room looked at the man in silence. It is a
      horrible thing to hear a man cry. A woman can sob from the top of her
      palate, or her lips, or anywhere else, but a man must cry from his
      diaphragm, and it rends him to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor devil!&rsquo; said the colonel, coughing tremendously. &lsquo;We ought to send
      him to hospital. He&rsquo;s been man-handled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the adjutant loved his carbines. They were to him as his
      grandchildren, the men standing in the first place. He grunted
      rebelliously: &lsquo;I can understand an Afghan stealing, because he&rsquo;s built
      that way. But I can&rsquo;t understand his crying. That makes it worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brandy must have affected Dirkovitch, for he lay back in his chair and
      stared at the ceiling. There was nothing special in the ceiling beyond a
      shadow as of a huge black coffin. Owing to some peculiarity in the
      construction of the mess-room this shadow was always thrown when the
      candles were lighted. It never disturbed the digestion of the White
      Hussars. They were in fact rather proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he going to cry all night?&rsquo; said the colonel, &lsquo;or are we supposed to
      sit up with little Mildred&rsquo;s guest until he feels better?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the chair threw up his head and stared at the mess. &lsquo;Oh, my
      God!&rsquo; he said, and every soul in the mess rose to his feet. Then the
      Lushkar captain did a deed for which he ought to have been given the
      Victoria Cross&mdash;distinguished gallantry in a fight against
      overwhelming curiosity. He picked up his team with his eyes as the hostess
      picks up the ladies at the opportune moment, and pausing only by the
      colonel&rsquo;s chair to say, &lsquo;This isn&rsquo;t OUR affair, you know, sir,&rsquo; led them
      into the verandah and the gardens. Hira Singh was the last to go, and he
      looked at Dirkovitch. But Dirkovitch had departed into a brandy-paradise
      of his own. His lips moved without sound and he was studying the coffin on
      the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;White&mdash;white all over,&rsquo; said Basset-Holmer, the adjutant. &lsquo;What a
      pernicious renegade he must be! I wonder where he came from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel shook the man gently by the arm, and &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. The man stared round the mess-room and smiled in the
      colonel&rsquo;s face. Little Mildred, who was always more of a woman than a man
      till &lsquo;Boot and saddle&rsquo; was sounded, repeated the question in a voice that
      would have drawn confidences from a geyser. The man only smiled.
      Dirkovitch at the far end of the table slid gently from his chair to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      No son of Adam in this present imperfect world can mix the Hussars&rsquo; 
      champagne with the Hussars&rsquo; brandy by five and eight glasses of each
      without remembering the pit whence he was digged and descending thither.
      The band began to play the tune with which the White Hussars from the date
      of their formation have concluded all their functions. They would sooner
      be disbanded than abandon that tune; it is a part of their system. The man
      straightened himself in his chair and drummed on the table with his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should entertain lunatics,&rsquo; said the colonel. &lsquo;Call a
      guard and send him off to the cells. We&rsquo;ll look into the business in the
      morning. Give him a glass of wine first though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mildred filled a sherry-glass with the brandy and thrust it over to
      the man. He drank, and the tune rose louder, and he straightened himself
      yet more. Then he put out his long-taloned hands to a piece of plate
      opposite and fingered it lovingly. There was a mystery connected with that
      piece of plate, in the shape of a spring which converted what was a
      seven-branched candlestick, three springs on each side and one in the
      middle, into a sort of wheel-spoke candelabrum. He found the spring,
      pressed it, and laughed weakly. He rose from his chair and inspected a
      picture on the wall, then moved on to another picture, the mess watching
      him without a word. When he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head and
      seemed distressed. A piece of plate representing a mounted hussar in full
      uniform caught his eye. He pointed to it, and then to the mantelpiece with
      inquiry in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it&mdash;Oh what is it?&rsquo; said little Mildred. Then as a mother
      might speak to a child, &lsquo;That is a horse. Yes, a horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly came the answer in a thick, passionless guttural&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, I&mdash;have
      seen. But&mdash;where is THE horse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew back
      to give the stranger full room in his wanderings. There was no question of
      calling the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he spoke&mdash;very slowly, &lsquo;Where is OUR horse?&rsquo;

    <p>
      There is but one horse in the White Hussars, and his portrait hangs
      outside the door of the mess-room. He is the piebald drum-horse, the king
      of the regimental band, that served the regiment for seven-and-thirty
      years, and in the end was shot for old age. Half the mess tore the thing
      down from its place and thrust it into the man&rsquo;s hands. He placed it above
      the mantel-piece, it clattered on the ledge as his poor hands dropped it,
      and he staggered towards the bottom of the table, falling into Mildred&rsquo;s
      chair. Then all the men spoke to one another something after this fashion,
      &lsquo;The drum-horse hasn&rsquo;t hung over the mantelpiece since &lsquo;67.&rsquo; &lsquo;How does he
      know?&rsquo; &lsquo;Mildred, go and speak to him again.&rsquo; &lsquo;Colonel, what are you going
      to do?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, dry up, and give the poor devil a chance to pull himself
      together.&rsquo; &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible anyhow. The man&rsquo;s a lunatic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mildred stood at the colonel&rsquo;s side talking in his ear. &lsquo;Will you
      be good enough to take your seats please, gentlemen!&rsquo; he said, and the
      mess dropped into the chairs. Only Dirkovitch&rsquo;s seat, next to little
      Mildred&rsquo;s, was blank, and little Mildred himself had found Hira Singh&rsquo;s
      place. The wide-eyed mess-sergeant filled the glasses in deep silence.
      Once more the colonel rose, but his hand shook and the port spilled on the
      table as he looked straight at the man in little Mildred&rsquo;s chair and said
      hoarsely, &lsquo;Mr. Vice, the Queen.&rsquo; There was a little pause, but the man
      sprung to his feet and answered without hesitation, &lsquo;The Queen, God bless
      her!&rsquo; and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank between his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long and long ago, when the Empress of India was a young woman and there
      were no unclean ideals in the land, it was the custom of a few messes to
      drink the Queen&rsquo;s toast in broken glass, to the vast delight of the
      mess-contractors. The custom is now dead, because there is nothing to
      break anything for, except now and again the word of a Government, and
      that has been broken already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That settles it,&rsquo; said the colonel, with a gasp. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not a sergeant.
      What in the world is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire mess echoed the word, and the volley of questions would have
      scared any man. It was no wonder that the ragged, filthy invader could
      only smile and shake his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      From under the table, calm and smiling, rose Dirkovitch, who had been
      roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body. By the side of the
      man he rose, and the man shrieked and grovelled. It was a horrible sight
      coming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought
      the strayed wits together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirkovitch made no offer to raise him, but little Mildred heaved him up in
      an instant. It is not good that a gentleman who can answer to the Queen&rsquo;s
      toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of Cossacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hasty action tore the wretch&rsquo;s upper clothing nearly to the waist, and
      his body was seamed with dry black scars. There is only one weapon in the
      world that cuts: in parallel lines, and it is neither the cane nor the
      cat. Dirkovitch saw the marks, and the pupils of his eyes dilated. Also
      his face changed. He said something that sounded like Shto ve takete, and
      the man fawning answered, Chetyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said everybody together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His number. That is number four, you know.&rsquo; Dirkovitch spoke very
      thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has a Queen&rsquo;s officer to do with a qualified number?&rsquo; said the
      Colonel, and an unpleasant growl ran round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I tell?&rsquo; said the affable Oriental with a sweet smile. &lsquo;He is a&mdash;how
      you have it?&mdash;escape&mdash;run-a-way, from over there.&rsquo; He nodded
      towards the darkness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak to him if he&rsquo;ll answer you, and speak to him gently,&rsquo; said little
      Mildred, settling the man in a chair. It seemed most improper to all
      present that Dirkovitch should sip brandy as he talked in purring,
      spitting Russian to the creature who answered so feebly and with such
      evident dread. But since Dirkovitch appeared to understand no one said a
      word. All breathed heavily, leaning forward, in the long gaps of the
      conversation. The next time that they have no engagements on hand the
      White Hussars intend to go to St. Petersburg in a body to learn Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does not know how many years ago,&rsquo; said Dirkovitch, facing the mess,
      &lsquo;but he says it was very long ago in a war. I think that there was an
      accident. He says he was of this glorious and distinguished regiment in
      the war.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rolls! The rolls! Holmer, get the rolls!&rsquo; said little Mildred, and
      the adjutant dashed off bare-headed to the orderly-room, where the
      muster-rolls of the regiment were kept. He returned just in time to hear
      Dirkovitch conclude, &lsquo;Therefore, my dear friends, I am most sorry to say
      there was an accident which would have been reparable if he had apologised
      to that our colonel, which he had insulted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed another growl which the colonel tried to beat down. The mess
      was in no mood just then to weigh insults to Russian colonels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does not remember, but I think that there was an accident, and so he
      was not exchanged among the prisoners, but he was sent to another place&mdash;how
      do you say?&mdash;the country. SO, he says, he came here. He does not know
      how he came. Eh? He was at Chepany&rsquo;&mdash;the man caught the word, nodded,
      and shivered&mdash;&lsquo;at Zhigansk and Irkutsk. I cannot understand how he
      escaped. He says, too, that he was in the forests for many years, but how
      many years he has forgotten&mdash;that with many things. It was an
      accident; done because he did not apologise to that our colonel. Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of echoing Dirkovitch&rsquo;s sigh of regret, it is sad to record that
      the White Hussars livelily exhibited un-Christian delight and other
      emotions, hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality. Holmer flung
      the frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table, and the men flung
      themselves at these.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady! Fifty-six&mdash;fifty-five&mdash;fifty-four,&rsquo; said Holmer. &lsquo;Here
      we are. &ldquo;Lieutenant Austin Limmason. MISSING.&rdquo; That was before Sebastopol.
      What an infernal shame! Insulted one of their colonels, and was quietly
      shipped off. Thirty years of his life wiped out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he never apologised. Said he&rsquo;d see him damned first,&rsquo; chorused the
      mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor chap! I suppose he never had the chance afterwards. How did he come
      here?&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dingy heap in the chair could give no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know who you are?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It laughed weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that you are Limmason&mdash;Lieutenant Limmason of the White
      Hussars?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly as a shot came the answer, in a slightly surprised tone, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m
      Limmason, of course.&rsquo; The light died out in his eyes, and the man
      collapsed, watching every motion of Dirkovitch with terror. A flight from
      Siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind, but it does not seem
      to lead to continuity of thought. The man could not explain how, like a
      homing pigeon, he had found his way to his own old mess again. Of what he
      had suffered or seen he knew nothing. He cringed before Dirkovitch as
      instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the candlestick, sought the
      picture of the drum-horse, and answered to the toast of the Queen. The
      rest was a blank that the dreaded Russian tongue could only in part
      remove. His head bowed on his breast, and he giggled and cowered
      alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil that lived in the brandy prompted Dirkovitch at this extremely
      inopportune moment to make a speech. He rose, swaying slightly, gripped
      the table-edge, while his eyes glowed like opals, and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fellow-soldiers glorious&mdash;true friends and hospitables. It was an
      accident, and deplorable&mdash;most deplorable.&rsquo; Here he smiled sweetly
      all round the mess. &lsquo;But you will think of this little, little thing. So
      little, is it not? The Czar! Posh! I slap my fingers&mdash;I snap my
      fingers at him. Do I believe in him? No! But in us Slav who has done
      nothing, HIM I believe. Seventy&mdash;how much&mdash;millions peoples that
      have done nothing&mdash;not one thing. Posh! Napoleon was an episode.&rsquo; He
      banged a hand on the table. &lsquo;Hear you, old peoples, we have done nothing
      in the world&mdash;out here. All our work is to do; and it shall be done,
      old peoples. Get a-way!&rsquo; He waved his hand imperiously, and pointed to the
      man. &lsquo;You see him. He is not good to see. He was just one little&mdash;oh,
      so little&mdash;accident, that no one remembered. Now he is THAT! So will
      you be, brother-soldiers so brave&mdash;so will you be. But you will never
      come back. You will all go where he is gone, or&rsquo;&mdash;he pointed to the
      great coffin-shadow on the ceiling, and muttering, &lsquo;Seventy millions&mdash;get
      a-way, you old peoples,&rsquo; fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sweet, and to the point,&rsquo; said little Mildred. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of getting
      wroth? Let&rsquo;s make this poor devil comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands of
      the White Hussars. The lieutenant had returned only to go away again three
      days later, when the wail of the Dead March, and the tramp of the
      squadrons, told the wondering Station, who saw no gap in the mess-table,
      that an officer of the regiment had resigned his new-found commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dirkovitch, bland, supple, and always genial, went away too by a night
      train. Little Mildred and another man saw him off, for he was the guest of
      the mess, and even had he smitten the colonel with the open hand, the law
      of that mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Dirkovitch, and a pleasant journey,&rsquo; said little Mildred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Au revoir,&rsquo; said the Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! But we thought you were going home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but I will come again. My dear friends, is that road shut?&rsquo; He
      pointed to where the North Star burned over the Khyber Pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove! I forgot. Of course. Happy to meet you, old man, any time you
      like. Got everything you want? Cheroots, ice, bedding? That&rsquo;s all right.
      Well, au revoir, Dirkovitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Um,&rsquo; said the other man, as the tail-lights of the train grew small. &lsquo;Of&mdash;all&mdash;the&mdash;unmitigated&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mildred answered nothing, but watched the North Star and hummed a
      selection from a recent Simla burlesque that had much delighted the White
      Hussars. It ran&mdash;
    </p>

    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Indus had risen in flood without warning. Last night it was a fordable
      shallow; to-night five miles of raving muddy water parted bank and caving
      bank, and the river was still rising under the moon. A litter borne by six
      bearded men, all unused to the work, stopped in the white sand that
      bordered the whiter plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will,&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;We dare not cross to-night, even in a boat.
      Let us light a fire and cook food. We be tired men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at the litter inquiringly. Within, the Deputy Commissioner of
      the Kot-Kumharsen district lay dying of fever. They had brought him across
      country, six fighting-men of a frontier clan that he had won over to the
      paths of a moderate righteousness, when he had broken down at the foot of
      their inhospitable hills. And Tallantire, his assistant, rode with them,
      heavy-hearted as heavy-eyed with sorrow and lack of sleep. He had served
      under the sick man for three years, and had learned to love him as men
      associated in toil of the hardest learn to love&mdash;or hate. Dropping
      from his horse he parted the curtains of the litter and peered inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Orde&mdash;Orde, old man, can you hear? We have to wait till the river
      goes down, worse luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear,&rsquo; returned a dry whisper. &lsquo;Wait till the river goes down. I
      thought we should reach camp before the dawn. Polly knows. She&rsquo;ll meet
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the litter-men stared across the river and caught a faint twinkle
      of light on the far side. He whispered to Tallantire, &lsquo;There are his
      camp-fires, and his wife. They will cross in the morning, for they have
      better boats. Can he live so long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallantire shook his head. Yardley-Orde was very near to death. What need
      to vex his soul with hopes of a meeting that could not be? The river
      gulped at the banks, brought down a cliff of sand, and snarled the more
      hungrily. The litter-men sought for fuel in the waste-dried camel-thorn
      and refuse of the camps that had waited at the ford. Their sword-belts
      clinked as they moved softly in the haze of the moonlight, and
      Tallantire&rsquo;s horse coughed to explain that he would like a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m cold too,&rsquo; said the voice from the litter. &lsquo;I fancy this is the end.
      Poor Polly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallantire rearranged the blankets. Khoda Dad Khan, seeing this, stripped
      off his own heavy-wadded sheepskin coat and added it to the pile. &lsquo;I shall
      be warm by the fire presently,&rsquo; said he. Tallantire took the wasted body
      of his chief into his arms and held it against his breast. Perhaps if they
      kept him very warm Orde might live to see his wife once more. If only
      blind Providence would send a three-foot fall in the river!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; said Orde faintly. &lsquo;Sorry to be a nuisance, but is&mdash;is
      there anything to drink?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave him milk and whisky, and Tallantire felt a little warmth against
      his own breast. Orde began to mutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I mind dying,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s leaving Polly and the
      district. Thank God! we have no children. Dick, you know, I&rsquo;m dipped&mdash;awfully
      dipped&mdash;debts in my first five years&rsquo; service. It isn&rsquo;t much of a
      pension, but enough for her. She has her mother at home. Getting there is
      the difficulty. And&mdash;and&mdash;you see, not being a soldier&rsquo;s wife&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll arrange the passage home, of course,&rsquo; said Tallantire quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not nice to think of sending round the hat; but, good Lord! how many
      men I lie here and remember that had to do it! Morten&rsquo;s dead&mdash;he was
      of my year. Shaughnessy is dead, and he had children; I remember he used
      to read us their school-letters; what a bore we thought him! Evans is dead&mdash;Kot-Kumharsen
      killed him! Ricketts of Myndonie is dead&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going too. &ldquo;Man
      that is born of a woman is small potatoes and few in the hill.&rdquo; That
      reminds me, Dick; the four Khusru Kheyl villages in our border want a
      one-third remittance this spring. That&rsquo;s fair; their crops are bad. See
      that they get it, and speak to Ferris about the canal. I should like to
      have lived till that was finished; it means so much for the North-Indus
      villages&mdash;but Ferris is an idle beggar&mdash;wake him up. You&rsquo;ll have
      charge of the district till my successor comes. I wish they would appoint
      you permanently; you know the folk. I suppose it will be Bullows, though.
      &lsquo;Good man, but too weak for frontier work; and he doesn&rsquo;t understand the
      priests. The blind priest at Jagai will bear watching. You&rsquo;ll find it in
      my papers,&mdash;in the uniform-case, I think. Call the Khusru Kheyl men
      up; I&rsquo;ll hold my last public audience. Khoda Dad Khan!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader of the men sprang to the side of the litter, his companions
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men, I&rsquo;m dying,&rsquo; said Orde quickly, in the vernacular; &lsquo;and soon there
      will be no more Orde Sahib to twist your tails and prevent you from
      raiding cattle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid this thing!&rsquo; broke out the deep bass chorus. &lsquo;The Sahib is not
      going to die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is; and then he will know whether Mahomed speaks truth, or Moses.
      But you must be good men, when I am not here. Such of you as live in our
      borders must pay your taxes quietly as before. I have spoken of the
      villages to be gently treated this year. Such of you as live in the hills
      must refrain from cattle-lifting, and burn no more thatch, and turn a deaf
      ear to the voice of the priests, who, not knowing the strength of the
      Government, would lead you into foolish wars, wherein you will surely die
      and your crops be eaten by strangers. And you must not sack any caravans,
      and must leave your arms at the police-post when you come in; as has been
      your custom, and my order. And Tallantire Sahib will be with you, but I do
      not know who takes my place. I speak now true talk, for I am as it were
      already dead, my children,&mdash;for though ye be strong men, ye are
      children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And thou art our father and our mother,&rsquo; broke in Khoda Dad Khan with an
      oath. &lsquo;What shall we do, now there is no one to speak for us, or to teach
      us to go wisely!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There remains Tallantire Sahib. Go to him; he knows your talk and your
      heart. Keep the young men quiet, listen to the old men, and obey. Khoda
      Dad Khan, take my ring. The watch and chain go to thy brother. Keep those
      things for my sake, and I will speak to whatever God I may encounter and
      tell him that the Khusru Kheyl are good men. Ye have my leave to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Khoda Dad Khan, the ring upon his finger, choked audibly as he caught the
      well-known formula that closed an interview. His brother turned to look
      across the river. The dawn was breaking, and a speck of white showed on
      the dull silver of the stream. &lsquo;She comes,&rsquo; said the man under his breath.
      &lsquo;Can he live for another two hours?&rsquo; And he pulled the newly-acquired
      watch out of his belt and looked uncomprehendingly at the dial, as he had
      seen Englishmen do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours the bellying sail tacked and blundered up and down the
      river, Tallantire still clasping Orde in his arms, and Khoda Dad Khan
      chafing his feet. He spoke now and again of the district and his wife,
      but, as the end neared, more frequently of the latter. They hoped he did
      not know that she was even then risking her life in a crazy native boat to
      regain him. But the awful foreknowledge of the dying deceived them.
      Wrenching himself forward, Orde looked through the curtains and saw how
      near was the sail. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Polly,&rsquo; he said simply, though his mouth was
      wried with agony. &lsquo;Polly and&mdash;the grimmest practical joke ever played
      on a man. Dick&mdash;you&rsquo;ll&mdash;have&mdash;to&mdash;explain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And an hour later Tallantire met on the bank a woman in a gingham
      riding-habit and a sun-hat who cried out to him for her husband&mdash;her
      boy and her darling&mdash;while Khoda Dad Khan threw himself face-down on
      the sand and covered his eyes.

    <p>
      The very simplicity of the notion was its charm. What more easy to win a
      reputation for far-seeing statesmanship, originality, and, above all,
      deference to the desires of the people, than by appointing a child of the
      country to the rule of that country? Two hundred millions of the most
      loving and grateful folk under Her Majesty&rsquo;s dominion would laud the fact,
      and their praise would endure for ever. Yet he was indifferent to praise
      or blame, as befitted the Very Greatest of All the Viceroys. His
      administration was based upon principle, and the principle must be
      enforced in season and out of season. His pen and tongue had created the
      New India, teeming with possibilities&mdash;loud-voiced, insistent, a
      nation among nations&mdash;all his very own. Wherefore the Very Greatest
      of All the Viceroys took another step in advance, and with it counsel of
      those who should have advised him on the appointment of a successor to
      Yardley-Orde. There was a gentleman and a member of the Bengal Civil
      Service who had won his place and a university degree to boot in fair and
      open competition with the sons of the English. He was cultured, of the
      world, and, if report spoke truly, had wisely and, above all,
      sympathetically ruled a crowded district in South-Eastern Bengal. He had
      been to England and charmed many drawing-rooms there. His name, if the
      Viceroy recollected aright, was Mr. Grish Chunder De, M. A. In short, did
      anybody see any objection to the appointment, always on principle, of a
      man of the people to rule the people? The district in South-Eastern Bengal
      might with advantage, he apprehended, pass over to a younger civilian of
      Mr. G. C. De&rsquo;s nationality (who had written a remarkably clever pamphlet
      on the political value of sympathy in administration); and Mr. G. C. De
      could be transferred northward to Kot-Kumharsen. The Viceroy was averse,
      on principle, to interfering with appointments under control of the
      Provincial Governments. He wished it to be understood that he merely
      recommended and advised in this instance. As regarded the mere question of
      race, Mr. Grish Chunder De was more English than the English, and yet
      possessed of that peculiar sympathy and insight which the best among the
      best Service in the world could only win to at the end of their service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stern, black-bearded kings who sit about the Council-board of India
      divided on the step, with the inevitable result of driving the Very
      Greatest of All the Viceroys into the borders of hysteria, and a
      bewildered obstinacy pathetic as that of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The principle is sound enough,&rsquo; said the weary-eyed Head of the Red
      Provinces in which Kot-Kumharsen lay, for he too held theories. &lsquo;The only
      difficulty is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put the screw on the District officials; brigade De with a very strong
      Deputy Commissioner on each side of him; give him the best assistant in
      the Province; rub the fear of God into the people beforehand; and if
      anything goes wrong, say that his colleagues didn&rsquo;t back him up. All these
      lovely little experiments recoil on the District-Officer in the end,&rsquo; said
      the Knight of the Drawn Sword with a truthful brutality that made the Head
      of the Red Provinces shudder. And on a tacit understanding of this kind
      the transfer was accomplished, as quietly as might be for many reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sad to think that what goes for public opinion in India did not
      generally see the wisdom of the Viceroy&rsquo;s appointment. There were not
      lacking indeed hireling organs, notoriously in the pay of a tyrannous
      bureaucracy, who more than hinted that His Excellency was a fool, a
      dreamer of dreams, a doctrinaire, and, worst of all, a trifler with the
      lives of men. &lsquo;The Viceroy&rsquo;s Excellence Gazette,&rsquo; published in Calcutta,
      was at pains to thank &lsquo;Our beloved Viceroy for once more and again thus
      gloriously vindicating the potentialities of the Bengali nations for
      extended executive and administrative duties in foreign parts beyond our
      ken. We do not at all doubt that our excellent fellow-townsman, Mr. Grish
      Chunder De, Esq., M. A., will uphold the prestige of the Bengali,
      notwithstanding what underhand intrigue and peshbundi may be set on foot
      to insidiously nip his fame and blast his prospects among the proud
      civilians, some of which will now have to serve under a despised native
      and take orders too. How will you like that, Misters? We entreat our
      beloved Viceroy still to substantiate himself superiorly to race-prejudice
      and colour-blindness, and to allow the flower of this now OUR Civil
      Service all the full pays and allowances granted to his more fortunate
      brethren.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When does this man take over charge? I&rsquo;m alone just now, and I gather
      that I&rsquo;m to stand fast under him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have cared for a transfer?&rsquo; said Bullows keenly. Then, laying
      his hand on Tallantire&rsquo;s shoulder: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re all in the same boat; don&rsquo;t
      desert us. And yet, why the devil should you stay, if you can get another
      charge?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Orde&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said Tallantire simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s De&rsquo;s now. He&rsquo;s a Bengali of the Bengalis, crammed with code
      and case law; a beautiful man so far as routine and deskwork go, and
      pleasant to talk to. They naturally have always kept him in his own home
      district, where all his sisters and his cousins and his aunts lived,
      somewhere south of Dacca. He did no more than turn the place into a
      pleasant little family preserve, allowed his subordinates to do what they
      liked, and let everybody have a chance at the shekels. Consequently he&rsquo;s
      immensely popular down there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do with that. How on earth am I to explain to the
      district that they are going to be governed by a Bengali? Do you&mdash;does
      the Government, I mean&mdash;suppose that the Khusru Kheyl will sit quiet
      when they once know? What will the Mahomedan heads of villages say? How
      will the police&mdash;Muzbi Sikhs and Pathans&mdash;how will THEY work
      under him? We couldn&rsquo;t say anything if the Government appointed a sweeper;
      but my people will say a good deal, you know that. It&rsquo;s a piece of cruel
      folly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear boy, I know all that, and more. I&rsquo;ve represented it, and have
      been told that I am exhibiting &ldquo;culpable and puerile prejudice.&rdquo; By Jove,
      if the Khusru Kheyl don&rsquo;t exhibit something worse than that I don&rsquo;t know
      the Border! The chances are that you will have the district alight on your
      hands, and I shall have to leave my work and help you pull through. I
      needn&rsquo;t ask you to stand by the Bengali man in every possible way. You&rsquo;ll
      do that for your own sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For Orde&rsquo;s. I can&rsquo;t say that I care twopence personally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass. It&rsquo;s grievous enough, God knows, and the Government will
      know later on; but that&rsquo;s no reason for your sulking. YOU must try to run
      the district, YOU must stand between him and as much insult as possible;
      YOU must show him the ropes; YOU must pacify the Khusru Kheyl, and just
      warn Curbar of the Police to look out for trouble by the way. I&rsquo;m always
      at the end of a telegraph-wire, and willing to peril my reputation to hold
      the district together. You&rsquo;ll lose yours, of course, If you keep things
      straight, and he isn&rsquo;t actually beaten with a stick when he&rsquo;s on tour,
      he&rsquo;ll get all the credit. If anything goes wrong, you&rsquo;ll be told that you
      didn&rsquo;t support him loyally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what I&rsquo;ve got to do,&rsquo; said Tallantire wearily, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m going to
      do it. But it&rsquo;s hard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The work is with us, the event is with Allah,&mdash;as Orde used to say
      when he was more than usually in hot water.&rsquo; And Bullows rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That two gentlemen in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Bengal Civil Service should thus
      discuss a third, also in that service, and a cultured and affable man
      withal, seems strange and saddening. Yet listen to the artless babble of
      the Blind Mullah of Jagai, the priest of the Khusru Kheyl, sitting upon a
      rock overlooking the Border. Five years before, a chance-hurled shell from
      a screw-gun battery had dashed earth in the face of the Mullah, then
      urging a rush of Ghazis against half a dozen British bayonets. So he
      became blind, and hated the English none the less for the little accident.
      Yardley-Orde knew his failing, and had many times laughed at him therefor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dogs you are,&rsquo; said the Blind Mullah to the listening tribesmen round the
      fire. &lsquo;Whipped dogs! Because you listened to Orde Sahib and called him
      father and behaved as his children, the British Government have proven how
      they regard you. Orde Sahib ye know is dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ai! ai! ai!&rsquo; said half a dozen voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was a man. Comes now in his stead, whom think ye? A Bengali of Bengal&mdash;an
      eater of fish from the South.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lie!&rsquo; said Khoda Dad Khan. &lsquo;And but for the small matter of thy
      priesthood, I&rsquo;d drive my gun butt-first down thy throat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho, art thou there, lickspittle of the English? Go in to-morrow across
      the Border to pay service to Orde Sahib&rsquo;s successor, and thou shalt slip
      thy shoes at the tent-door of a Bengali, as thou shalt hand thy offering
      to a Bengali&rsquo;s black fist. This I know; and in my youth, when a young man
      spoke evil to a Mullah holding the doors of Heaven and Hell, the gun-butt
      was not rammed down the Mullah&rsquo;s gullet. No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blind Mullah hated Khoda Dad Khan with Afghan hatred; both being
      rivals for the headship of the tribe; but the latter was feared for bodily
      as the other for spiritual gifts. Khoda Dad Khan looked at Orde&rsquo;s ring and
      grunted, &lsquo;I go in to-morrow because I am not an old fool, preaching war
      against the English. If the Government, smitten with madness, have done
      this, then...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; croaked the Mullah, &lsquo;thou wilt take out the young men and strike
      at the four villages within the Border?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or wring thy neck, black raven of Jehannum, for a bearer of ill-tidings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Khoda Dad Khan oiled his long locks with great care, put on his best
      Bokhara belt, a new turban-cap and fine green shoes, and accompanied by a
      few friends came down from the hills to pay a visit to the new Deputy
      Commissioner of Kot-Kumharsen. Also he bore tribute&mdash;four or five
      priceless gold mohurs of Akbar&rsquo;s time in a white handkerchief. These the
      Deputy Commissioner would touch and remit. The little ceremony used to be
      a sign that, so far as Khoda Dad Khan&rsquo;s personal influence went, the
      Khusru Kheyl would be good boys,&mdash;till the next time; especially if
      Khoda Dad Khan happened to like the new Deputy Commissioner. In
      Yardley-Orde&rsquo;s consulship his visit concluded with a sumptuous dinner and
      perhaps forbidden liquors; certainly with some wonderful tales and great
      good-fellowship. Then Khoda Dad Khan would swagger back to his hold,
      vowing that Orde Sahib was one prince and Tallantire Sahib another, and
      that whosoever went a-raiding into British territory would be flayed
      alive. On this occasion he found the Deputy Commissioner&rsquo;s tents looking
      much as usual. Regarding himself as privileged he strode through the open
      door to confont a suave, portly Bengali in English costume writing at a
      table. Unversed in the elevating influence of education, and not in the
      least caring for university degrees, Khoda Dad Khan promptly set the man
      down for a Babu&mdash;the native clerk of the Deputy Commissioner&mdash;a
      hated and despised animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; said he cheerfully. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your master, Babujee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am the Deputy Commissioner,&rsquo; said the gentleman in English. Now he
      overvalued the effects of university degrees, and stared Khoda Dad Khan in
      the face. But if from your earliest infancy you have been accustomed to
      look on battle, murder, and sudden death, if spilt blood affects your
      nerves as much as red paint, and, above all, if you have faithfully
      believed that the Bengali was the servant of all Hindustan, and that all
      Hindustan was vastly inferior to your own large, lustful self, you can
      endure, even though uneducated, a very large amount of looking over. You
      can even stare down a graduate of an Oxford college if the latter has been
      born in a hothouse, of stock bred in a hothouse, and fearing physical pain
      as some men fear sin; especially if your opponent&rsquo;s mother has frightened
      him to sleep in his youth with horrible stories of devils inhabiting
      Afghanistan, and dismal legends of the black North. The eyes behind the
      gold spectacles sought the floor. Khoda Dad Khan chuckled, and swung out
      to find Tallantire hard by. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said he roughly, thrusting the coins
      before him, &lsquo;touch and remit. That answers for MY good behaviour. But, O
      Sahib, has the Government gone mad to send a black Bengali dog to us? And
      am I to pay service to such an one? And are you to work under him? What
      does it mean?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is an order,&rsquo; said Tallantire. He had expected
      something of this kind. &lsquo;He is a very clever S-sahib.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He a Sahib! He&rsquo;s a kala admi&mdash;a black man&mdash;unfit to run at the
      tail of a potter&rsquo;s donkey. All the peoples of the earth have harried
      Bengal. It is written. Thou knowest when we of the North wanted women or
      plunder whither went we? To Bengal&mdash;where else? What child&rsquo;s talk is
      this of Sahibdom&mdash;after Orde Sahib too! Of a truth the Blind Mullah
      was right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of him?&rsquo; asked Tallantire uneasily. He mistrusted that old man with
      his dead eyes and his deadly tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, now, because of the oath that I sware to Orde Sahib when we watched
      him die by the river yonder, I will tell. In the first place, is it true
      that the English have set the heel of the Bengali on their own neck, and
      that there is no more English rule in the land?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here,&rsquo; said Tallantire, &lsquo;and I serve the Maharanee of England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Mullah said otherwise, and further that because we loved Orde Sahib
      the Government sent us a pig to show that we were dogs, who till now have
      been held by the strong hand. Also that they were taking away the white
      soldiers, that more Hindustanis might come, and that all was changing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the worst of ill-considered handling of a very large country. What
      looks so feasible in Calcutta, so right in Bombay, so unassailable in
      Madras, is misunderstood by the North and entirely changes its complexion
      on the banks of the Indus. Khoda Dad Khan explained as clearly as he could
      that, though he himself intended to be good, he really could not answer
      for the more reckless members of his tribe under the leadership of the
      Blind Mullah. They might or they might not give trouble, but they
      certainly had no intention whatever of obeying the new Deputy
      Commissioner. Was Tallantire perfectly sure that in the event of any
      systematic border-raiding the force in the district could put it down
      promptly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell the Mullah if he talks any more fool&rsquo;s talk,&rsquo; said Tallantire
      curtly, &lsquo;that he takes his men on to certain death, and his tribe to
      blockade, trespass-fine, and blood-money. But why do I talk to one who no
      longer carries weight in the counsels of the tribe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Khoda Dad Khan pocketed that insult. He had learned something that he much
      wanted to know, and returned to his hills to be sarcastically complimented
      by the Mullah, whose tongue raging round the camp-fires was deadlier flame
      than ever dung-cake fed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Be pleased to consider here for a moment the unknown district of
      Kot-Kumharsen. It lay cut lengthways by the Indus under the line of the
      Khusru hills&mdash;ramparts of useless earth and tumbled stone. It was
      seventy miles long by fifty broad, maintained a population of something
      less than two hundred thousand, and paid taxes to the extent of forty
      thousand pounds a year on an area that was by rather more than half sheer,
      hopeless waste. The cultivators were not gentle people, the miners for
      salt were less gentle still, and the cattle-breeders least gentle of all.
      A police-post in the top right-hand corner and a tiny mud fort in the top
      left-hand corner prevented as much salt-smuggling and cattle-lifting as
      the influence of the civilians could not put down; and in the bottom
      right-hand corner lay Jumala, the district headquarters&mdash;a pitiful
      knot of lime-washed barns facetiously rented as houses, reeking with
      frontier fever, leaking in the rain, and ovens in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this place that Grish Chunder De was travelling, there formally
      to take over charge of the district. But the news of his coming had gone
      before. Bengalis were as scarce as poodles among the simple Borderers, who
      cut each other&rsquo;s heads open with their long spades and worshipped
      impartially at Hindu and Mahomedan shrines. They crowded to see him,
      pointing at him, and diversely comparing him to a gravid milch-buffalo, or
      a broken-down horse, as their limited range of metaphor prompted. They
      laughed at his police-guard, and wished to know how long the burly Sikhs
      were going to lead Bengali apes. They inquired whether he had brought his
      women with him, and advised him explicitly not to tamper with theirs. It
      remained for a wrinkled hag by the roadside to slap her lean breasts as he
      passed, crying, &lsquo;I have suckled six that could have eaten six thousand of
      HIM. The Government shot them, and made this That a king!&rsquo; Whereat a
      blue-turbaned huge-boned plough-mender shouted, &lsquo;Have hope, mother o&rsquo; 
      mine! He may yet go the way of thy wastrels.&rsquo; And the children, the little
      brown puff-balls, regarded curiously. It was generally a good thing for
      infancy to stray into Orde Sahib&rsquo;s tent, where copper coins were to be won
      for the mere wishing, and tales of the most authentic, such as even their
      mothers knew but the first half of. No! This fat black man could never
      tell them how Pir Prith hauled the eye-teeth out of ten devils; how the
      big stones came to lie all in a row on top of the Khusru hills, and what
      happened if you shouted through the village-gate to the gray wolf at even
      &lsquo;Badl Khas is dead.&rsquo; Meantime Grish Chunder De talked hastily and much to
      Tallantire, after the manner of those who are &lsquo;more English than the
      English,&rsquo;&mdash;of Oxford and &lsquo;home,&rsquo; with much curious book-knowledge of
      bump-suppers, cricket-matches, hunting-runs, and other unholy sports of
      the alien. &lsquo;We must get these fellows in hand,&rsquo; he said once or twice
      uneasily; &lsquo;get them well in hand, and drive them on a tight rein. No use,
      you know, being slack with your district.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And a moment later Tallantire heard Debendra Nath De, who brotherliwise
      had followed his kinsman&rsquo;s fortune and hoped for the shadow of his
      protection as a pleader, whisper in Bengali, &lsquo;Better are dried fish at
      Dacca than drawn swords at Delhi. Brother of mine, these men are devils,
      as our mother said. And you will always have to ride upon a horse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That night there was a public audience in a broken-down little town thirty
      miles from Jumala, when the new Deputy Commissioner, in reply to the
      greetings of the subordinate native officials, delivered a speech. It was
      a carefully thought-out speech, which would have been very valuable had
      not his third sentence begun with three innocent words, &lsquo;Hamara hookum hai&mdash;It
      is my order.&rsquo; Then there was a laugh, clear and bell-like, from the back
      of the big tent, where a few border landholders sat, and the laugh grew
      and scorn mingled with it, and the lean, keen face of Debendra Nath De
      paled, and Grish Chunder turning to Tallantire spake: &lsquo;YOU&mdash;you put
      up this arrangement.&rsquo; Upon that instant the noise of hoofs rang without,
      and there entered Curbar, the District Superintendent of Police, sweating
      and dusty. The State had tossed him into a corner of the province for
      seventeen weary years, there to check smuggling of salt, and to hope for
      promotion that never came. He had forgotten how to keep his white uniform
      clean, had screwed rusty spurs into patent-leather shoes, and clothed his
      head indifferently with a helmet or a turban. Soured, old, worn with heat
      and cold, he waited till he should be entitled to sufficient pension to
      keep him from starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tallantire,&rsquo; said he, disregarding Grish Chunder De, &lsquo;come outside. I
      want to speak to you.&rsquo; They withdrew. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s this,&rsquo; continued Curbar. &lsquo;The
      Khusru Kheyl have rushed and cut up half a dozen of the coolies on
      Ferris&rsquo;s new canal-embankment; killed a couple of men and carried off a
      woman. I wouldn&rsquo;t trouble you about that&mdash;Ferris is after them and
      Hugonin, my assistant, with ten mounted police. But that&rsquo;s only the
      beginning, I fancy. Their fires are out on the Hassan Ardeb heights, and
      unless we&rsquo;re pretty quick there&rsquo;ll be a flare-up all along our Border.
      They are sure to raid the four Khusru villages on our side of the line;
      there&rsquo;s been bad blood between them for years; and you know the Blind
      Mullah has been preaching a holy war since Orde went out. What&rsquo;s your
      notion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn!&rsquo; said Tallantire thoughtfully. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve begun quick. Well, it seems
      to me I&rsquo;d better ride off to Fort Ziar and get what men I can there to
      picket among the lowland villages, if it&rsquo;s not too late. Tommy Dodd
      commands at Fort Ziar, I think. Ferris and Hugonin ought to teach the
      canal-thieves a lesson, and&mdash;No, we can&rsquo;t have the Head of the Police
      ostentatiously guarding the Treasury. You go back to the canal. I&rsquo;ll wire
      Bullows to come into Jumala with a strong police-guard, and sit on the
      Treasury. They won&rsquo;t touch the place, but it looks well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I insist upon knowing what this means,&rsquo; said the voice of
      the Deputy Commissioner, who had followed the speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Curbar, who being in the Police could not understand that
      fifteen years of education must, on principle, change the Bengali into a
      Briton. &lsquo;There has been a fight on the Border, and heaps of men are
      killed. There&rsquo;s going to be another fight, and heaps more will be killed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because the teeming millions of this district don&rsquo;t exactly approve of
      you, and think that under your benign rule they are going to have a good
      time. It strikes me that you had better make arrangements. I act, as you
      know, by your orders. What do you advise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I take you all to witness that I have not yet assumed charge of
      the district,&rsquo; stammered the Deputy Commissioner, not in the tones of the
      &lsquo;more English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I thought so. Well, as I was saying, Tallantire, your plan is sound.
      Carry it out. Do you want an escort?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; only a decent horse. But how about wiring to headquarters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy, from the colour of his cheeks, that your superior officer will
      send some wonderful telegrams before the night&rsquo;s over. Let him do that,
      and we shall have half the troops of the province coming up to see what&rsquo;s
      the trouble. Well, run along, and take care of yourself&mdash;the Khusru
      Kheyl jab upwards from below, remember. Ho! Mir Khan, give Tallantire
      Sahib the best of the horses, and tell five men to ride to Jumala with the
      Deputy Commissioner Sahib Bahadur. There is a hurry toward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was; and it was not in the least bettered by Debendra Nath De
      clinging to a policeman&rsquo;s bridle and demanding the shortest, the very
      shortest way to Jumala. Now originality is fatal to the Bengali. Debendra
      Nath should have stayed with his brother, who rode steadfastly for Jumala
      on the railway-line, thanking gods entirely unknown to the most catholic
      of universities that he had not taken charge of the district, and could
      still&mdash;happy resource of a fertile race!&mdash;fall sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I grieve to say that when he reached his goal two policemen, not
      devoid of rude wit, who had been conferring together as they bumped in
      their saddles, arranged an entertainment for his behoof. It consisted of
      first one and then the other entering his room with prodigious details of
      war, the massing of bloodthirsty and devilish tribes, and the burning of
      towns. It was almost as good, said these scamps, as riding with Curbar
      after evasive Afghans. Each invention kept the hearer at work for half an
      hour on telegrams which the sack of Delhi would hardly have justified. To
      every power that could move a bayonet or transfer a terrified man, Grish
      Chunder De appealed telegraphically. He was alone, his assistants had
      fled, and in truth he had not taken over charge of the district. Had the
      telegrams been despatched many things would have occurred; but since the
      only signaller in Jumala had gone to bed, and the station-master, after
      one look at the tremendous pile of paper, discovered that railway
      regulations forbade the forwarding of imperial messages, policemen Ram
      Singh and Nihal Singh were fain to turn the stuff into a pillow and slept
      on it very comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallantire drove his spurs into a rampant skewbald stallion with
      china-blue eyes, and settled himself for the forty-mile ride to Fort Ziar.
      Knowing his district blindfold, he wasted no time hunting for short cuts,
      but headed across the richer grazing-ground to the ford where Orde had
      died and been buried. The dusty ground deadened the noise of his horse&rsquo;s
      hoofs, the moon threw his shadow, a restless goblin, before him, and the
      heavy dew drenched him to the skin. Hillock, scrub that brushed against
      the horse&rsquo;s belly, unmetalled road where the whip-like foliage of the
      tamarisks lashed his forehead, illimitable levels of lowland furred with
      bent and speckled with drowsing cattle, waste, and hillock anew, dragged
      themselves past, and the skewbald was labouring in the deep sand of the
      Indus-ford. Tallantire was conscious of no distinct thought till the nose
      of the dawdling ferry-boat grounded on the farther side, and his horse
      shied snorting at the white headstone of Orde&rsquo;s grave. Then he uncovered,
      and shouted that the dead might hear, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re out, old man! Wish me
      luck.&rsquo; In the chill of the dawn he was hammering with a stirrup-iron at
      the gate of Fort Ziar, where fifty sabres of that tattered regiment, the
      Belooch Beshaklis were supposed to guard Her Majesty&rsquo;s interests along a
      few hundred miles of Border. This particular fort was commanded by a
      subaltern, who, born of the ancient family of the Derouletts, naturally
      answered to the name of Tommy Dodd. Him Tallantire found robed in a
      sheepskin coat, shaking with fever like an aspen, and trying to read the
      native apothecary&rsquo;s list of invalids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve come, too,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re all sick here, and I don&rsquo;t
      think I can horse thirty men; but we&rsquo;re bub&mdash;bub&mdash;bub blessed
      willing. Stop, does this impress you as a trap or a lie?&rsquo; He tossed a
      scrap of paper to Tallantire, on which was written painfully in crabbed
      Gurmukhi, &lsquo;We cannot hold young horses. They will feed after the moon goes
      down in the four border villages issuing from the Jagai pass on the next
      night.&rsquo; Then in English round hand&mdash;&lsquo;Your sincere friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good man!&rsquo; said Tallantire. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Khoda Dad Khan&rsquo;s work, I know. It&rsquo;s
      the only piece of English he could ever keep in his head, and he is
      immensely proud of it. He is playing against the Blind Mullah for his own
      hand&mdash;the treacherous young ruffian!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know the politics of the Khusru Kheyl, but if you&rsquo;re satisfied, I
      am. That was pitched in over the gate-head last night, and I thought we
      might pull ourselves together and see what was on. Oh, but we&rsquo;re sick with
      fever here and no mistake! Is this going to be a big business, think you?&rsquo; 
      said Tommy Dodd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallantire gave him briefly the outlines of the case, and Tommy Dodd
      whistled and shook with fever alternately. That day he devoted to
      strategy, the art of war, and the enlivenment of the invalids, till at
      dusk there stood ready forty-two troopers, lean, worn, and dishevelled,
      whom Tommy Dodd surveyed with pride, and addressed thus: &lsquo;O men! If you
      die you will go to Hell. Therefore endeavour to keep alive. But if you go
      to Hell that place cannot be hotter than this place, and we are not told
      that we shall there suffer from fever. Consequently be not afraid of
      dying. File out there!&rsquo; They grinned, and went.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      It will be long ere the Khusru Kheyl forget their night attack on the
      lowland villages. The Mullah had promised an easy victory and unlimited
      plunder; but behold, armed troopers of the Queen had risen out of the very
      earth, cutting, slashing, and riding down under the stars, so that no man
      knew where to turn, and all feared that they had brought an army about
      their ears, and ran back to the hills. In the panic of that flight more
      men were seen to drop from wounds inflicted by an Afghan knife jabbed
      upwards, and yet more from long-range carbine-fire. Then there rose a cry
      of treachery, and when they reached their own guarded heights, they had
      left, with some forty dead and sixty wounded, all their confidence in the
      Blind Mullah on the plains below. They clamoured, swore, and argued round
      the fires; the women wailing for the lost, and the Mullah shrieking curses
      on the returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Khoda Dad Khan, eloquent and unbreathed, for he had taken no part in
      the fight, rose to improve the occasion. He pointed out that the tribe
      owed every item of its present misfortune to the Blind Mullah, who had
      lied in every possible particular and talked them into a trap. It was
      undoubtedly an insult that a Bengali, the son of a Bengali, should presume
      to administer the Border, but that fact did not, as the Mullah pretended,
      herald a general time of license and lifting; and the inexplicable madness
      of the English had not in the least impaired their power of guarding their
      marches. On the contrary, the baffled and out-generalled tribe would now,
      just when their food-stock was lowest, be blockaded from any trade with
      Hindustan until they had sent hostages for good behaviour, paid
      compensation for disturbance, and blood-money at the rate of thirty-six
      English pounds per head for every villager that they might have slain.
      &lsquo;And ye know that those lowland dogs will make oath that we have slain
      scores. Will the Mullah pay the fines or must we sell our guns?&rsquo; A low
      growl ran round the fires. &lsquo;Now, seeing that all this is the Mullah&rsquo;s
      work, and that we have gained nothing but promises of Paradise thereby, it
      is in my heart that we of the Khusru Kheyl lack a shrine whereat to pray.
      We are weakened, and henceforth how shall we dare to cross into the Madar
      Kheyl border, as has been our custom, to kneel to Pir Sajji&rsquo;s tomb? The
      Madar men will fall upon us, and rightly. But our Mullah is a holy man. He
      has helped two score of us into Paradise this night. Let him therefore
      accompany his flock, and we will build over his body a dome of the blue
      tiles of Mooltan, and burn lamps at his feet every Friday night. He shall
      be a saint: we shall have a shrine; and there our women shall pray for
      fresh seed to fill the gaps in our fighting-tale. How think you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A grim chuckle followed the suggestion, and the soft wheep, wheep of
      unscabbarded knives followed the chuckle. It was an excellent notion, and
      met a long felt want of the tribe. The Mullah sprang to his feet, glaring
      with withered eyeballs at the drawn death he could not see, and calling
      down the curses of God and Mahomed on the tribe. Then began a game of
      blind man&rsquo;s buff round and between the fires, whereof Khuruk Shah, the
      tribal poet, has sung in verse that will not die.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tickled him gently under the armpit with the knife-point. He leaped
      aside screaming, only to feel a cold blade drawn lightly over the back of
      his neck, or a rifle-muzzle rubbing his beard. He called on his adherents
      to aid him, but most of these lay dead on the plains, for Khoda Dad Khan
      had been at some pains to arrange their decease. Men described to him the
      glories of the shrine they would build, and the little children clapping
      their hands cried, &lsquo;Run, Mullah, run! There&rsquo;s a man behind you!&rsquo; In the
      end, when the sport wearied, Khoda Dad Khan&rsquo;s brother sent a knife home
      between his ribs. &lsquo;Wherefore,&rsquo; said Khoda Dad Khan with charming
      simplicity, &lsquo;I am now Chief of the Khusru Kheyl!&rsquo; No man gainsaid him; and
      they all went to sleep very stiff and sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the plain below Tommy Dodd was lecturing on the beauties of a cavalry
      charge by night, and Tallantire, bowed on his saddle, was gasping
      hysterically because there was a sword dangling from his wrist flecked
      with the blood of the Khusru Kheyl, the tribe that Orde had kept in leash
      so well. When a Rajpoot trooper pointed out that the skewbald&rsquo;s right ear
      had been taken off at the root by some blind slash of its unskilled rider,
      Tallantire broke down altogether, and laughed and sobbed till Tommy Dodd
      made him lie down and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must wait about till the morning,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I wired to the Colonel
      just before we left, to send a wing of the Beshaklis after us. He&rsquo;ll be
      furious with me for monopolising the fun, though. Those beggars in the
      hills won&rsquo;t give us any more trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell the Beshaklis to go on and see what has happened to Curbar on
      the canal. We must patrol the whole line of the Border. You&rsquo;re quite sure,
      Tommy, that&mdash;that stuff was&mdash;was only the skewbald&rsquo;s ear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, quite,&rsquo; said Tommy. &lsquo;You just missed cutting off his head. <i>I</i>
      saw you when we went into the mess. Sleep, old man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon brought two squadrons of Beshaklis and a knot of furious brother
      officers demanding the court-martial of Tommy Dodd for &lsquo;spoiling the
      picnic,&rsquo; and a gallop across country to the canal-works where Ferris,
      Curbar, and Hugonin were haranguing the terror-stricken coolies on the
      enormity of abandoning good work and high pay, merely because half a dozen
      of their fellows had been cut down. The sight of a troop of the Beshaklis
      restored wavering confidence, and the police-hunted section of the Khusru
      Kheyl had the joy of watching the canal-bank humming with life as usual,
      while such of their men as had taken refuge in the watercourses and
      ravines were being driven out by the troopers. By sundown began the
      remorseless patrol of the Border by police and trooper, most like the
      cow-boys&rsquo; eternal ride round restless cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Khoda Dad Khan to his fellows, pointing out a line of
      twinkling fires below, &lsquo;ye may see how far the old order changes. After
      their horse will come the little devil-guns that they can drag up to the
      tops of the hills, and, for aught I know, to the clouds when we crown the
      hills. If the tribe-council thinks good, I will go to Tallantire Sahib&mdash;who
      loves me&mdash;and see if I can stave off at least the blockade. Do I
      speak for the tribe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, speak for the tribe in God&rsquo;s name. How those accursed fires wink! Do
      the English send their troops on the wire&mdash;or is this the work of the
      Bengali?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Khoda Dad Khan went down the hill he was delayed by an interview with a
      hard-pressed tribesman, which caused him to return hastily for something
      he had forgotten. Then, handing himself over to the two troopers who had
      been chasing his friend, he claimed escort to Tallantire Sahib, then with
      Bullows at Jumala. The Border was safe, and the time for reasons in
      writing had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank Heaven!&rsquo; said Bullows, &lsquo;that the trouble came at once. Of course we
      can never put down the reason in black and white, but all India will
      understand. And it is better to have a sharp short outbreak than five
      years of impotent administration inside the Border. It costs less. Grish
      Chunder De has reported himself sick, and has been transferred to his own
      province without any sort of reprimand. He was strong on not having taken
      over the district.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Tallantire bitterly. &lsquo;Well, what am I supposed to have
      done that was wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you will be told that you exceeded all your powers, and should have
      reported, and written, and advised for three weeks until the Khusru Kheyl
      could really come down in force. But I don&rsquo;t think the authorities will
      dare to make a fuss about it. They&rsquo;ve had their lesson. Have you seen
      Curbar&rsquo;s version of the affair? He can&rsquo;t write a report, but he can speak
      the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of the truth? He&rsquo;d much better tear up the report. I&rsquo;m
      sick and heartbroken over it all. It was so utterly unnecessary&mdash;except
      in that it rid us of that Babu.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Entered unabashed Khoda Dad Khan, a stuffed forage-net in his hand, and
      the troopers behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May you never be tired!&rsquo; said he cheerily. &lsquo;Well, Sahibs, that was a good
      fight, and Naim Shah&rsquo;s mother is in debt to you, Tallantire Sahib. A clean
      cut, they tell me, through jaw, wadded coat, and deep into the
      collar-bone. Well done! But I speak for the tribe. There has been a fault&mdash;a
      great fault. Thou knowest that I and mine, Tallantire Sahib, kept the oath
      we sware to Orde Sahib on the banks of the Indus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As an Afghan keeps his knife&mdash;sharp on one side, blunt on the
      other,&rsquo; said Tallantire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The better swing in the blow, then. But I speak God&rsquo;s truth. Only the
      Blind Mullah carried the young men on the tip of his tongue, and said that
      there was no more Border-law because a Bengali had been sent, and we need
      not fear the English at all. So they came down to avenge that insult and
      get plunder. Ye know what befell, and how far I helped. Now five score of
      us are dead or wounded, and we are all shamed and sorry, and desire no
      further war. Moreover, that ye may better listen to us, we have taken off
      the head of the Blind Mullah, whose evil counsels have led us to folly. I
      bring it for proof,&rsquo;&mdash;and he heaved on the floor the head. &lsquo;He will
      give no more trouble, for I am chief now, and so I sit in a higher place
      at all audiences. Yet there is an offset to this head. That was another
      fault. One of the men found that black Bengali beast, through whom this
      trouble arose, wandering on horseback and weeping. Reflecting that he had
      caused loss of much good life, Alla Dad Khan, whom, if you choose, I will
      to-morrow shoot, whipped off this head, and I bring it to you to cover
      your shame, that ye may bury it. See, no man kept the spectacles, though
      they were of gold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly rolled to Tallantire&rsquo;s feet the crop-haired head of a spectacled
      Bengali gentleman, open-eyed, open-mouthed&mdash;the head of Terror
      incarnate. Bullows bent down. &lsquo;Yet another blood-fine and a heavy one,
      Khoda Dad Khan, for this is the head of Debendra Nath, the man&rsquo;s brother.
      The Babu is safe long since. All but the fools of the Khusru Kheyl know
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I care not for carrion. Quick meat for me. The thing was under our
      hills asking the road to Jumala and Alla Dad Khan showed him the road to
      Jehannum, being, as thou sayest, but a fool. Remains now what the
      Government will do to us. As to the blockade&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who art thou, seller of dog&rsquo;s flesh,&rsquo; thundered Tallantire, &lsquo;to speak of
      terms and treaties? Get hence to the hills&mdash;go, and wait there
      starving, till it shall please the Government to call thy people out for
      punishment&mdash;children and fools that ye be! Count your dead, and be
      still. Best assured that the Government will send you a MAN!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; returned Khoda Dad Khan, &lsquo;for we also be men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked Tallantire between the eyes, he added, &lsquo;And by God, Sahib,
      may thou be that man!&rsquo;

      gifts to Sheikh Badl&rsquo;s shrine so often, that I know God will give us a son&mdash;a
      man-child that shall grow into a man. Think of this and be glad. My mother
      shall be his mother till I can take him again, and the mullah of the
      Pattan mosque shall cast his nativity&mdash;God send he be born in an
      auspicious hour!&mdash;and then, and then thou wilt never weary of me, thy
      slave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since when hast thou been a slave, my queen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since the beginning&mdash;till this mercy came to me. How could I be sure
      of thy love when I knew that I had been bought with silver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, that was the dowry. I paid it to thy mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she has buried it, and sits upon it all day long like a hen. What
      talk is yours of dower! I was bought as though I had been a Lucknow
      dancing-girl instead of a child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Art thou sorry for the sale?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sorrowed; but to-day I am glad. Thou wilt never cease to love me
      now?&mdash;answer, my king.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never&mdash;never. No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even though the mem-log&mdash;the white women of thy own blood&mdash;love
      thee? And remember, I have watched them driving in the evening; they are
      very fair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen fire-balloons by the hundred. I have seen the moon, and&mdash;then
      I saw no more fire-balloons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ameera clapped her hands and laughed. &lsquo;Very good talk,&rsquo; she said. Then
      with an assumption of great stateliness, &lsquo;It is enough. Thou hast my
      permission to depart,&mdash;if thou wilt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man did not move. He was sitting on a low red-lacquered couch in a
      room furnished only with a blue and white floor-cloth, some rugs, and a
      very complete collection of native cushions. At his feet sat a woman of
      sixteen, and she was all but all the world in his eyes. By every rule and
      law she should have been otherwise, for he was an Englishman, and she a
      Mussulman&rsquo;s daughter bought two years before from her mother, who, being
      left without money, would have sold Ameera shrieking to the Prince of
      Darkness if the price had been sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a contract entered into with a light heart; but even before the
      girl had reached her bloom she came to fill the greater portion of John
      Holden&rsquo;s life. For her, and the withered hag her mother, he had taken a
      little house overlooking the great red-walled city, and found,&mdash;when
      the marigolds had sprung up by the well in the courtyard and Ameera had
      established herself according to her own ideas of comfort, and her mother
      had ceased grumbling at the inadequacy of the cooking-places, the distance
      from the daily market, and at matters of house-keeping in general,&mdash;that
      the house was to him his home. Any one could enter his bachelor&rsquo;s bungalow
      by day or night, and the life that he led there was an unlovely one. In
      the house in the city his feet only could pass beyond the outer courtyard
      to the women&rsquo;s rooms; and when the big wooden gate was bolted behind him
      he was king in his own territory, with Ameera for queen. And there was
      going to be added to this kingdom a third person whose arrival Holden felt
      inclined to resent. It interfered with his perfect happiness. It
      disarranged the orderly peace of the house that was his own. But Ameera
      was wild with delight at the thought of it, and her mother not less so.
      The love of a man, and particularly a white man, was at the best an
      inconstant affair, but it might, both women argued, be held fast by a
      baby&rsquo;s hands. &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; Ameera would always say, &lsquo;then he will never
      care for the white mem-log. I hate them all&mdash;I hate them all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will go back to his own people in time,&rsquo; said the mother; &lsquo;but by the
      blessing of God that time is yet afar off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden sat silent on the couch thinking of the future, and his thoughts
      were not pleasant. The drawbacks of a double life are manifold. The
      Government, with singular care, had ordered him out of the station for a
      fortnight on special duty in the place of a man who was watching by the
      bedside of a sick wife. The verbal notification of the transfer had been
      edged by a cheerful remark that Holden ought to think himself lucky in
      being a bachelor and a free man. He came to break the news to Ameera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not good,&rsquo; she said slowly, &lsquo;but it is not all bad. There is my
      mother here, and no harm will come to me&mdash;unless indeed I die of pure
      joy. Go thou to thy work and think no troublesome thoughts. When the days
      are done I believe... nay, I am sure. And&mdash;and then I shall lay HIM
      in thy arms, and thou wilt love me for ever. The train goes to-night, at
      midnight is it not? Go now, and do not let thy heart be heavy by cause of
      me. But thou wilt not delay in returning? Thou wilt not stay on the road
      to talk to the bold white mem-log. Come back to me swiftly, my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the courtyard to reach his horse that was tethered to the
      gate-post, Holden spoke to the white-haired old watchman who guarded the
      house, and bade him under certain contingencies despatch the filled-up
      telegraph-form that Holden gave him. It was all that could be done, and
      with the sensations of a man who has attended his own funeral Holden went
      away by the night mail to his exile. Every hour of the day he dreaded the
      arrival of the telegram, and every hour of the night he pictured to
      himself the death of Ameera. In consequence his work for the State was not
      of first-rate quality, nor was his temper towards his colleagues of the
      most amiable. The fortnight ended without a sign from his home, and, torn
      to pieces by his anxieties, Holden returned to be swallowed up for two
      precious hours by a dinner at the club, wherein he heard, as a man hears
      in a swoon, voices telling him how execrably he had performed the other
      man&rsquo;s duties, and how he had endeared himself to all his associates. Then
      he fled on horseback through the night with his heart in his mouth. There
      was no answer at first to his blows on the gate, and he had just wheeled
      his horse round to kick it in when Pir Khan appeared with a lantern and
      held his stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has aught occurred?&rsquo; said Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The news does not come from my mouth, Protector of the Poor, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
      He held out his shaking hand as befitted the bearer of good news who is
      entitled to a reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden hurried through the courtyard. A light burned in the upper room.
      His horse neighed in the gateway, and he heard a shrill little wail that
      sent all the blood into the apple of his throat. It was a new voice, but
      it did not prove that Ameera was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; he called up the narrow brick staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry of delight from Ameera, and then the voice of the mother,
      tremulous with old age and pride&mdash;&lsquo;We be two women and&mdash;the&mdash;man&mdash;thy&mdash;son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the threshold of the room Holden stepped on a naked dagger, that was
      laid there to avert ill-luck, and it broke at the hilt under his impatient
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God is great!&rsquo; cooed Ameera in the half-light. &lsquo;Thou hast taken his
      misfortunes on thy head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, but how is it with thee, life of my life? Old woman, how is it with
      her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has forgotten her sufferings for joy that the child is born. There is
      no harm; but speak softly,&rsquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It only needed thy presence to make me all well,&rsquo; said Ameera. &lsquo;My king,
      thou hast been very long away. What gifts hast thou for me? Ah, ah! It is
      I that bring gifts this time. Look, my life, look. Was there ever such a
      babe? Nay, I am too weak even to clear my arm from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rest then, and do not talk. I am here, bachari [little woman].&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well said, for there is a bond and a heel-rope [peecharee] between us now
      that nothing can break. Look&mdash;canst thou see in this light? He is
      without spot or blemish. Never was such a man-child. Ya illah! he shall be
      a pundit&mdash;no, a trooper of the Queen. And, my life, dost thou love me
      as well as ever, though I am faint and sick and worn? Answer truly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yea. I love as I have loved, with all my soul. Lie still, pearl, and
      rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then do not go. Sit by my side here&mdash;so. Mother, the lord of this
      house needs a cushion. Bring it.&rsquo; There was an almost imperceptible
      movement on the part of the new life that lay in the hollow of Ameera&rsquo;s
      arm. &lsquo;Aho!&rsquo; she said, her voice breaking with love. &lsquo;The babe is a
      champion from his birth. He is kicking me in the side with mighty kicks.
      Was there ever such a babe! And he is ours to us&mdash;thine and mine. Put
      thy hand on his head, but carefully, for he is very young, and men are
      unskilled in such matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very cautiously Holden touched with the tips of his fingers the downy
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is of the faith,&rsquo; said Ameera; &lsquo;for lying here in the night-watches I
      whispered the call to prayer and the profession of faith into his ears.
      And it is most marvellous that he was born upon a Friday, as I was born.
      Be careful of him, my life; but he can almost grip with his hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden found one helpless little hand that closed feebly on his finger.
      And the clutch ran through his body till it settled about his heart. Till
      then his sole thought had been for Ameera. He began to realise that there
      was some one else in the world, but he could not feel that it was a
      veritable son with a soul. He sat down to think, and Ameera dozed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get hence, sahib,&rsquo; said her mother under her breath. &lsquo;It is not good that
      she should find you here on waking. She must be still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I go,&rsquo; said Holden submissively. &lsquo;Here be rupees. See that my baba gets
      fat and finds all that he needs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The chink of the silver roused Ameera. &lsquo;I am his mother, and no hireling,&rsquo; 
      she said weakly. &lsquo;Shall I look to him more or less for the sake of money?
      Mother, give it back. I have born my lord a son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep sleep of weakness came upon her almost before the sentence was
      completed. Holden went down to the courtyard very softly with his heart at
      ease. Pir Khan, the old watchman, was chuckling with delight. &lsquo;This house
      is now complete,&rsquo; he said, and without further comment thrust into
      Holden&rsquo;s hands the hilt of a sabre worn many years ago when he, Pir Khan,
      served the Queen in the police. The bleat of a tethered goat came from the
      well-kerb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There be two,&rsquo; said Pir Khan, &lsquo;two goats of the best. I bought them, and
      they cost much money; and since there is no birth-party assembled their
      flesh will be all mine. Strike craftily, sahib! &lsquo;Tis an ill-balanced sabre
      at the best. Wait till they raise their heads from cropping the
      marigolds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why?&rsquo; said Holden, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the birth-sacrifice. What else? Otherwise the child being unguarded
      from fate may die. The Protector of the Poor knows the fitting words to be
      said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden had learned them once with little thought that he would ever speak
      them in earnest. The touch of the cold sabre-hilt in his palm turned
      suddenly to the clinging grip of the child upstairs&mdash;the child that
      was his own son&mdash;and a dread of loss filled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strike!&rsquo; said Pir Khan. &lsquo;Never life came into the world but life was paid
      for it. See, the goats have raised their heads. Now! With a drawing cut!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly knowing what he did Holden cut twice as he muttered the Mahomedan
      prayer that runs: &lsquo;Almighty! In place of this my son I offer life for
      life, blood for blood, head for head, bone for bone, hair for hair, skin
      for skin.&rsquo; The waiting horse snorted and bounded in his pickets at the
      smell of the raw blood that spirted over Holden&rsquo;s riding-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well smitten!&rsquo; said Pir Khan, wiping the sabre. &lsquo;A swordsman was lost in
      thee. Go with a light heart, Heaven-born. I am thy servant, and the
      servant of thy son. May the Presence live a thousand years and... the
      flesh of the goats is all mine?&rsquo; Pir Khan drew back richer by a month&rsquo;s
      pay. Holden swung himself into the saddle and rode off through the
      low-hanging wood-smoke of the evening. He was full of riotous exultation,
      alternating with a vast vague tenderness directed towards no particular
      object, that made him choke as he bent over the neck of his uneasy horse.
      &lsquo;I never felt like this in my life,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the club and
      pull myself together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A game of pool was beginning, and the room was full of men. Holden
      entered, eager to get to the light and the company of his fellows, singing
      at the top of his voice&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    In Baltimore a-walking, a lady I did meet!
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you?&rsquo; said the club-secretary from his corner. &lsquo;Did she happen to
      tell you that your boots were wringing wet? Great goodness, man, it&rsquo;s
      blood!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; said Holden, picking his cue from the rack. &lsquo;May I cut in? It&rsquo;s
      dew. I&rsquo;ve been riding through high crops. My faith! my boots are in a mess
      though!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;And if it be a girl she shall wear a wedding-ring,
     And if it be a boy he shall fight for his king,
     With his dirk, and his cap, and his little jacket blue,
     He shall walk the quarter-deck&mdash;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yellow on blue&mdash;green next player,&rsquo; said the marker monotonously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall walk the quarter-deck,&mdash;Am I green, marker? He shall walk
      the quarter-deck,&mdash;eh! that&rsquo;s a bad shot,&mdash;As his daddy used to
      do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that you have anything to crow about,&rsquo; said a zealous junior
      civilian acidly. &lsquo;The Government is not exactly pleased with your work
      when you relieved Sanders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does that mean a wigging from headquarters?&rsquo; said Holden with an
      abstracted smile. &lsquo;I think I can stand it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk beat up round the ever-fresh subject of each man&rsquo;s work, and
      steadied Holden till it was time to go to his dark empty bungalow, where
      his butler received him as one who knew all his affairs. Holden remained
      awake for the greater part of the night, and his dreams were pleasant
      ones.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old is he now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ya illah! What a man&rsquo;s question! He is all but six weeks old; and on this
      night I go up to the housetop with thee, my life, to count the stars. For
      that is auspicious. And he was born on a Friday under the sign of the Sun,
      and it has been told to me that he will outlive us both and get wealth.
      Can we wish for aught better, beloved?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing better. Let us go up to the roof, and thou shalt count
      the stars&mdash;but a few only, for the sky is heavy with cloud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The winter rains are late, and maybe they come out of season. Come,
      before all the stars are hid. I have put on my richest jewels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast forgotten the best of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ai! Ours. He comes also. He has never yet seen the skies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ameera climbed the narrow staircase that led to the flat roof. The child,
      placid and unwinking, lay in the hollow of her right arm, gorgeous in
      silver-fringed muslin with a small skull-cap on his head. Ameera wore all
      that she valued most. The diamond nose-stud that takes the place of the
      Western patch in drawing attention to the curve of the nostril, the gold
      ornament in the centre of the forehead studded with tallow-drop emeralds
      and flawed rubies, the heavy circlet of beaten gold that was fastened
      round her neck by the softness of the pure metal, and the chinking
      curb-patterned silver anklets hanging low over the rosy ankle-bone. She
      was dressed in jade-green muslin as befitted a daughter of the Faith, and
      from shoulder to elbow and elbow to wrist ran bracelets of silver tied
      with floss silk, frail glass bangles slipped over the wrist in proof of
      the slenderness of the hand, and certain heavy gold bracelets that had no
      part in her country&rsquo;s ornaments but, since they were Holden&rsquo;s gift and
      fastened with a cunning European snap, delighted her immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down by the low white parapet of the roof, overlooking the city
      and its lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are happy down there,&rsquo; said Ameera. &lsquo;But I do not think that they
      are as happy as we. Nor do I think the white mem-log are as happy. And
      thou?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know they are not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dost thou know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They give their children over to the nurses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never seen that,&rsquo; said Ameera with a sigh, &lsquo;nor do I wish to see.
      Ahi!&mdash;she dropped her head on Holden&rsquo;s shoulder,&mdash;&lsquo;I have
      counted forty stars, and I am tired. Look at the child, love of my life,
      he is counting too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby was staring with round eyes at the dark of the heavens. Ameera
      placed him in Holden&rsquo;s arms, and he lay there without a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall we call him among ourselves?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Look! Art thou ever
      tired of looking? He carries thy very eyes. But the mouth&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is thine, most dear. Who should know better than I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis such a feeble mouth. Oh, so small! And yet it holds my heart between
      its lips. Give him to me now. He has been too long away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, let him lie; he has not yet begun to cry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When he cries thou wilt give him back&mdash;eh? What a man of mankind
      thou art! If he cried he were only the dearer to me. But, my life, what
      little name shall we give him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The small body lay close to Holden&rsquo;s heart. It was utterly helpless and
      very soft. He scarcely dared to breathe for fear of crushing it. The caged
      green parrot that is regarded as a sort of guardian-spirit in most native
      households moved on its perch and fluttered a drowsy wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is the answer,&rsquo; said Holden. &lsquo;Mian Mittu has spoken. He shall be
      the parrot. When he is ready he will talk mightily and run about. Mian
      Mittu is the parrot in thy&mdash;in the Mussulman tongue, is it not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why put me so far off?&rsquo; said Ameera fretfully. &lsquo;Let it be like unto some
      English name&mdash;but not wholly. For he is mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then call him Tota, for that is likest English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, Tota, and that is still the parrot. Forgive me, my lord, for a minute
      ago, but in truth he is too little to wear all the weight of Mian Mittu
      for name. He shall be Tota&mdash;our Tota to us. Hearest thou, O small
      one? Littlest, thou art Tota.&rsquo; She touched the child&rsquo;s cheek, and he
      waking wailed, and it was necessary to return him to his mother, who
      soothed him with the wonderful rhyme of Are koko, Jare koko! which says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh crow! Go crow! Baby&rsquo;s sleeping sound,
     And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound.
     Only a penny a pound, baba, only a penny a pound.
</pre>
    <p>
      Reassured many times as to the price of those plums, Tota cuddled himself
      down to sleep. The two sleek, white well-bullocks in the courtyard were
      steadily chewing the cud of their evening meal; old Pir Khan squatted at
      the head of Holden&rsquo;s horse, his police sabre across his knees, pulling
      drowsily at a big water-pipe that croaked like a bull-frog in a pond.
      Ameera&rsquo;s mother sat spinning in the lower verandah, and the wooden gate
      was shut and barred. The music of a marriage-procession came to the roof
      above the gentle hum of the city, and a string of flying-foxes crossed the
      face of the low moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have prayed,&rsquo; said Ameera after a long pause, &lsquo;I have prayed for two
      things. First, that I may die in thy stead if thy death is demanded, and
      in the second that I may die in the place of the child. I have prayed to
      the Prophet and to Beebee Miriam [the Virgin Mary]. Thinkest thou either
      will hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From thy lips who would not hear the lightest word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked for straight talk, and thou hast given me sweet talk. Will my
      prayers be heard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I say? God is very good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of that I am not sure. Listen now. When I die, or the child dies, what is
      thy fate? Living, thou wilt return to the bold white mem-log, for kind
      calls to kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a woman, no; with a man it is otherwise. Thou wilt in this life,
      later on, go back to thine own folk. That I could almost endure, for I
      should be dead. But in thy very death thou wilt be taken away to a strange
      place and a paradise that I do not know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will it be paradise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely, for who would harm thee? But we two&mdash;I and the child&mdash;shall
      be elsewhere, and we cannot come to thee, nor canst thou come to us. In
      the old days, before the child was born, I did not think of these things;
      but now I think of them always. It is very hard talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will fall as it will fall. To-morrow we do not know, but to-day and
      love we know well. Surely we are happy now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So happy that it were well to make our happiness assured. And thy Beebee
      Miriam should listen to me; for she is also a woman. But then she would
      envy me! It is not seemly for men to worship a woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden laughed aloud at Ameera&rsquo;s little spasm of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not seemly? Why didst thou not turn me from worship of thee, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou a worshipper! And of me? My king, for all thy sweet words, well I
      know that I am thy servant and thy slave, and the dust under thy feet. And
      I would not have it otherwise. See!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Holden could prevent her she stooped forward and touched his feet;
      recovering herself with a little laugh she hugged Tota closer to her
      bosom. Then, almost savagely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it true that the bold white mem-log live for three times the length of
      my life? Is it true that they make their marriages not before they are old
      women?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They marry as do others&mdash;when they are women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I know, but they wed when they are twenty-five. Is that true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ya illah! At twenty-five! Who would of his own will take a wife even of
      eighteen? She is a woman&mdash;aging every hour. Twenty-five! I shall be
      an old woman at that age, and&mdash;Those mem-log remain young for ever.
      How I hate them!&rsquo; &lsquo;What have they to do with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell. I know only that there may now be alive on this earth a
      woman ten years older than I who may come to thee and take thy love ten
      years after I am an old woman, gray-headed, and the nurse of Tota&rsquo;s son.
      That is unjust and evil. They should die too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, for all thy years thou art a child, and shalt be picked up and
      carried down the staircase.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tota! Have a care for Tota, my lord! Thou at least art as foolish as any
      babe!&rsquo; Ameera tucked Tota out of harm&rsquo;s way in the hollow of her neck, and
      was carried downstairs laughing in Holden&rsquo;s arms, while Tota opened his
      eyes and smiled after the manner of the lesser angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a silent infant, and, almost before Holden could realise that he
      was in the world, developed into a small gold-coloured little god and
      unquestioned despot of the house overlooking the city. Those were months
      of absolute happiness to Holden and Ameera&mdash;happiness withdrawn from
      the world, shut in behind the wooden gate that Pir Khan guarded. By day
      Holden did his work with an immense pity for such as were not so fortunate
      as himself, and a sympathy for small children that amazed and amused many
      mothers at the little station-gatherings. At nightfall he returned to
      Ameera,&mdash;Ameera, full of the wondrous doings of Tota; how he had been
      seen to clap his hands together and move his fingers with intention and
      purpose&mdash;which was manifestly a miracle&mdash;how later, he had of
      his own initiative crawled out of his low bedstead on to the floor and
      swayed on both feet for the space of three breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they were long breaths, for my heart stood still with delight,&rsquo; said
      Ameera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tota took the beasts into his councils&mdash;the well-bullocks, the
      little gray squirrels, the mongoose that lived in a hole near the well,
      and especially Mian Mittu, the parrot, whose tail he grievously pulled,
      and Mian Mittu screamed till Ameera and Holden arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O villain! Child of strength! This to thy brother on the house-top!
      Tobah, tobah! Fie! Fie! But I know a charm to make him wise as Suleiman
      and Aflatoun [Solomon and Plato]. Now look,&rsquo; said Ameera. She drew from an
      embroidered bag a handful of almonds. &lsquo;See! we count seven. In the name of
      God!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed Mian Mittu, very angry and rumpled, on the top of his cage, and
      seating herself between the babe and the bird she cracked and peeled an
      almond less white than her teeth. &lsquo;This is a true charm, my life, and do
      not laugh. See! I give the parrot one half and Tota the other.&rsquo; Mian Mittu
      with careful beak took his share from between Ameera&rsquo;s lips, and she
      kissed the other half into the mouth of the child, who ate it slowly with
      wondering eyes. &lsquo;This I will do each day of seven, and without doubt he
      who is ours will be a bold speaker and wise. Eh, Tota, what wilt thou be
      when thou art a man and I am gray-headed?&rsquo; Tota tucked his fat legs into
      adorable creases. He could crawl, but he was not going to waste the spring
      of his youth in idle speech. He wanted Mian Mittu&rsquo;s tail to tweak.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was advanced to the dignity of a silver belt&mdash;which, with a
      magic square engraved on silver and hung round his neck, made up the
      greater part of his clothing&mdash;he staggered on a perilous journey down
      the garden to Pir Khan and proffered him all his jewels in exchange for
      one little ride on Holden&rsquo;s horse, having seen his mother&rsquo;s mother
      chaffering with pedlars in the verandah. Pir Khan wept and set the untried
      feet on his own gray head in sign of fealty, and brought the bold
      adventurer to his mother&rsquo;s arms, vowing that Tota would be a leader of men
      ere his beard was grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hot evening, while he sat on the roof between his father and mother
      watching the never-ending warfare of the kites that the city boys flew, he
      demanded a kite of his own with Pir Khan to fly it, because he had a fear
      of dealing with anything larger than himself, and when Holden called him a
      &lsquo;spark,&rsquo; he rose to his feet and answered slowly in defence of his
      new-found individuality, &lsquo;Hum&rsquo;park nahin hai. Hum admi hai [I am no spark,
      but a man].&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The protest made Holden choke and devote himself very seriously to a
      consideration of Tota&rsquo;s future. He need hardly have taken the trouble. The
      delight of that life was too perfect to endure. Therefore it was taken
      away as many things are taken away in India&mdash;suddenly and without
      warning. The little lord of the house, as Pir Khan called him, grew
      sorrowful and complained of pains who had never known the meaning of pain.
      Ameera, wild with terror, watched him through the night, and in the
      dawning of the second day the life was shaken out of him by fever&mdash;the
      seasonal autumn fever. It seemed altogether impossible that he could die,
      and neither Ameera nor Holden at first believed the evidence of the little
      body on the bedstead. Then Ameera beat her head against the wall and would
      have flung herself down the well in the garden had Holden not restrained
      her by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      One mercy only was granted to Holden. He rode to his office in broad
      daylight and found waiting him an unusually heavy mail that demanded
      concentrated attention and hard work. He was not, however, alive to this
      kindness of the gods.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first shock of a bullet is no more than a brisk pinch. The wrecked
      body does not send in its protest to the soul till ten or fifteen seconds
      later. Holden realised his pain slowly, exactly as he had realised his
      happiness, and with the same imperious necessity for hiding all trace of
      it. In the beginning he only felt that there had been a loss, and that
      Ameera needed comforting, where she sat with her head on her knees
      shivering as Mian Mittu from the house-top called, Tota! Tota! Tota! Later
      all his world and the daily life of it rose up to hurt him. It was an
      outrage that any one of the children at the band-stand in the evening
      should be alive and clamorous, when his own child lay dead. It was more
      than mere pain when one of them touched him, and stories told by over-fond
      fathers of their children&rsquo;s latest performances cut him to the quick. He
      could not declare his pain. He had neither help, comfort, nor sympathy;
      and Ameera at the end of each weary day would lead him through the hell of
      self-questioning reproach which is reserved for those who have lost a
      child, and believe that with a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;more care
      it might have been saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; Ameera would say, &lsquo;I did not take sufficient heed. Did I, or
      did I not? The sun on the roof that day when he played so long alone and I
      was&mdash;ahi! braiding my hair&mdash;it may be that the sun then bred the
      fever. If I had warned him from the sun he might have lived. But, oh my
      life, say that I am guiltless! Thou knowest that I loved him as I love
      thee. Say that there is no blame on me, or I shall die&mdash;I shall die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no blame,&mdash;before God, none. It was written and how could
      we do aught to save? What has been, has been. Let it go, beloved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was all my heart to me. How can I let the thought go when my arm tells
      me every night that he is not here? Ahi! Ahi! O Tota, come back to me&mdash;come
      back again, and let us be all together as it was before!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, peace! For thine own sake, and for mine also, if thou lovest me&mdash;rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By this I know thou dost not care; and how shouldst thou? The white men
      have hearts of stone and souls of iron. Oh, that I had married a man of
      mine own people&mdash;though he beat me&mdash;and had never eaten the
      bread of an alien!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I an alien&mdash;mother of my son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What else&mdash;Sahib?... Oh, forgive me&mdash;forgive! The death has
      driven me mad. Thou art the life of my heart, and the light of my eyes,
      and the breath of my life, and&mdash;and I have put thee from me, though
      it was but for a moment. If thou goest away, to whom shall I look for
      help? Do not be angry. Indeed, it was the pain that spoke and not thy
      slave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know, I know. We be two who were three. The greater need therefore that
      we should be one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting on the roof as of custom. The night was a warm one in
      early spring, and sheet-lightning was dancing on the horizon to a broken
      tune played by far-off thunder. Ameera settled herself in Holden&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dry earth is lowing like a cow for the rain, and I&mdash;I am afraid.
      It was not like this when we counted the stars. But thou lovest me as much
      as before, though a bond is taken away? Answer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love more because a new bond has come out of the sorrow that we have
      eaten together, and that thou knowest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yea, I knew,&rsquo; said Ameera in a very small whisper. &lsquo;But it is good to
      hear thee say so, my life, who art so strong to help. I will be a child no
      more, but a woman and an aid to thee. Listen! Give me my sitar and I will
      sing bravely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the light silver-studded sitar and began a song of the great hero
      Rajah Rasalu. The hand failed on the strings, the tune halted, checked,
      and at a low note turned off to the poor little nursery-rhyme about the
      wicked crow&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound.
     Only a penny a pound, baba&mdash;only . . .
</pre>
    <p>
      Then came the tears, and the piteous rebellion against fate till she
      slept, moaning a little in her sleep, with the right arm thrown clear of
      the body as though it protected something that was not there. It was after
      this night that life became a little easier for Holden. The ever-present
      pain of loss drove him into his work, and the work repaid him by filling
      up his mind for nine or ten hours a day. Ameera sat alone in the house and
      brooded, but grew happier when she understood that Holden was more at
      ease, according to the custom of women. They touched happiness again, but
      this time with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was because we loved Tota that he died. The jealousy of God was upon
      us,&rsquo; said Ameera. &lsquo;I have hung up a large black jar before our window to
      turn the evil eye from us, and we must make no protestations of delight,
      but go softly underneath the stars, lest God find us out. Is that not good
      talk, worthless one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had shifted the accent on the word that means &lsquo;beloved,&rsquo; in proof of
      the sincerity of her purpose. But the kiss that followed the new
      christening was a thing that any deity might have envied. They went about
      henceforward saying, &lsquo;It is naught, it is naught;&rsquo; and hoping that all the
      Powers heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Powers were busy on other things. They had allowed thirty million
      people four years of plenty wherein men fed well and the crops were
      certain, and the birth-rate rose year by year; the districts reported a
      purely agricultural population varying from nine hundred to two thousand
      to the square mile of the overburdened earth; and the Member for Lower
      Tooting, wandering about India in pot-hat and frock-coat, talked largely
      of the benefits of British rule and suggested as the one thing needful the
      establishment of a duly qualified electoral system and a general bestowal
      of the franchise. His long-suffering hosts smiled and made him welcome,
      and when he paused to admire, with pretty picked words, the blossom of the
      blood-red dhak-tree that had flowered untimely for a sign of what was
      coming, they smiled more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Deputy Commissioner of Kot-Kumharsen, staying at the club for a
      day, who lightly told a tale that made Holden&rsquo;s blood run cold as he
      overheard the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t bother any one any more. Never saw a man so astonished in my
      life. By Jove, I thought he meant to ask a question in the House about it.
      Fellow-passenger in his ship&mdash;dined next him&mdash;bowled over by
      cholera and died in eighteen hours. You needn&rsquo;t laugh, you fellows. The
      Member for Lower Tooting is awfully angry about it; but he&rsquo;s more scared.
      I think he&rsquo;s going to take his enlightened self out of India.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give a good deal if he were knocked over. It might keep a few
      vestrymen of his kidney to their own parish. But what&rsquo;s this about
      cholera? It&rsquo;s full early for anything of that kind,&rsquo; said the warden of an
      unprofitable salt-lick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said the Deputy Commissioner reflectively. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got
      locusts with us. There&rsquo;s sporadic cholera all along the north&mdash;at
      least we&rsquo;re calling it sporadic for decency&rsquo;s sake. The spring crops are
      short in five districts, and nobody seems to know where the rains are.
      It&rsquo;s nearly March now. I don&rsquo;t want to scare anybody, but it seems to me
      that Nature&rsquo;s going to audit her accounts with a big red pencil this
      summer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just when I wanted to take leave, too!&rsquo; said a voice across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There won&rsquo;t be much leave this year, but there ought to be a great deal
      of promotion. I&rsquo;ve come in to persuade the Government to put my pet canal
      on the list of famine-relief works. It&rsquo;s an ill-wind that blows no good. I
      shall get that canal finished at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the old programme then,&rsquo; said Holden; &lsquo;famine, fever, and cholera?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no. Only local scarcity and an unusual prevalence of seasonal
      sickness. You&rsquo;ll find it all in the reports if you live till next year.
      You&rsquo;re a lucky chap. YOU haven&rsquo;t got a wife to send out of harm&rsquo;s way. The
      hill-stations ought to be full of women this year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re inclined to exaggerate the talk in the bazars&rsquo; said a
      young civilian in the Secretariat. &lsquo;Now I have observed&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay you have,&rsquo; said the Deputy Commissioner, &lsquo;but you&rsquo;ve a great
      deal more to observe, my son. In the meantime, I wish to observe to you&mdash;&rsquo; 
      and he drew him aside to discuss the construction of the canal that was so
      dear to his heart. Holden went to his bungalow and began to understand
      that he was not alone in the world, and also that he was afraid for the
      sake of another,&mdash;which is the most soul-satisfying fear known to
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months later, as the Deputy had foretold, Nature began to audit her
      accounts with a red pencil. On the heels of the spring-reapings came a cry
      for bread, and the Government, which had decreed that no man should die of
      want, sent wheat. Then came the cholera from all four quarters of the
      compass. It struck a pilgrim-gathering of half a million at a sacred
      shrine. Many died at the feet of their god; the others broke and ran over
      the face of the land carrying the pestilence with them. It smote a walled
      city and killed two hundred a day. The people crowded the trains, hanging
      on to the footboards and squatting on the roofs of the carriages, and the
      cholera followed them, for at each station they dragged out the dead and
      the dying. They died by the roadside, and the horses of the Englishmen
      shied at the corpses in the grass. The rains did not come, and the earth
      turned to iron lest man should escape death by hiding in her. The English
      sent their wives away to the hills and went about their work, coming
      forward as they were bidden to fill the gaps in the fighting-line. Holden,
      sick with fear of losing his chiefest treasure on earth, had done his best
      to persuade Ameera to go away with her mother to the Himalayas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I go?&rsquo; said she one evening on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is sickness, and people are dying, and all the white mem-log have
      gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All&mdash;unless perhaps there remain some old scald-head who vexes her
      husband&rsquo;s heart by running risk of death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay; who stays is my sister, and thou must not abuse her, for I will be a
      scald-head too. I am glad all the bold mem-log are gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I speak to a woman or a babe? Go to the hills and I will see to it
      that thou goest like a queen&rsquo;s daughter. Think, child. In a red-lacquered
      bullock-cart, veiled and curtained, with brass peacocks upon the pole and
      red cloth hangings. I will send two orderlies for guard, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace! Thou art the babe in speaking thus. What use are those toys to me?
      HE would have patted the bullocks and played with the housings. For his
      sake, perhaps,&mdash;thou hast made me very English&mdash;I might have
      gone. Now, I will not. Let the mem-log run.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their husbands are sending them, beloved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good talk. Since when hast thou been my husband to tell me what to
      do? I have but borne thee a son. Thou art only all the desire of my soul
      to me. How shall I depart when I know that if evil befall thee by the
      breadth of so much as my littlest finger-nail&mdash;is that not small?&mdash;I
      should be aware of it though I were in paradise. And here, this summer
      thou mayest die&mdash;ai, janee, die! and in dying they might call to tend
      thee a white woman, and she would rob me in the last of thy love!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But love is not born in a moment or on a death-bed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What dost thou know of love, stoneheart? She would take thy thanks at
      least and, by God and the Prophet and Beebee Miriam the mother of thy
      Prophet, that I will never endure. My lord and my love, let there be no
      more foolish talk of going away. Where thou art, I am. It is enough.&rsquo; She
      put an arm round his neck and a hand on his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are not many happinesses so complete as those that are snatched
      under the shadow of the sword. They sat together and laughed, calling each
      other openly by every pet name that could move the wrath of the gods. The
      city below them was locked up in its own torments. Sulphur fires blazed in
      the streets; the conches in the Hindu temples screamed and bellowed, for
      the gods were inattentive in those days. There was a service in the great
      Mahomedan shrine, and the call to prayer from the minarets was almost
      unceasing. They heard the wailing in the houses of the dead, and once the
      shriek of a mother who had lost a child and was calling for its return. In
      the gray dawn they saw the dead borne out through the city gates, each
      litter with its own little knot of mourners. Wherefore they kissed each
      other and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a red and heavy audit, for the land was very sick and needed a
      little breathing-space ere the torrent of cheap life should flood it anew.
      The children of immature fathers and undeveloped mothers made no
      resistance. They were cowed and sat still, waiting till the sword should
      be sheathed in November if it were so willed. There were gaps among the
      English, but the gaps were filled. The work of superintending
      famine-relief, cholera-sheds, medicine-distribution, and what little
      sanitation was possible, went forward because it was so ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden had been told to keep himself in readiness to move to replace the
      next man who should fall. There were twelve hours in each day when he
      could not see Ameera, and she might die in three. He was considering what
      his pain would be if he could not see her for three months, or if she died
      out of his sight. He was absolutely certain that her death would be
      demanded&mdash;so certain that when he looked up from the telegram and saw
      Pir Khan breathless in the doorway, he laughed aloud. &lsquo;And?&rsquo; said he,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When there is a cry in the night and the spirit flutters into the throat,
      who has a charm that will restore? Come swiftly, Heaven-born! It is the
      black cholera.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden galloped to his home. The sky was heavy with clouds, for the
      long-deferred rains were near and the heat was stifling. Ameera&rsquo;s mother
      met him in the courtyard, whimpering, &lsquo;She is dying. She is nursing
      herself into death. She is all but dead. What shall I do, sahib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ameera was lying in the room in which Tota had been born. She made no sign
      when Holden entered, because the human soul is a very lonely thing and,
      when it is getting ready to go away, hides itself in a misty borderland
      where the living may not follow. The black cholera does its work quietly
      and without explanation. Ameera was being thrust out of life as though the
      Angel of Death had himself put his hand upon her. The quick breathing
      seemed to show that she was either afraid or in pain, but neither eyes nor
      mouth gave any answer to Holden&rsquo;s kisses. There was nothing to be said or
      done. Holden could only wait and suffer. The first drops of the rain began
      to fall on the roof, and he could hear shouts of joy in the parched city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soul came back a little and the lips moved. Holden bent down to
      listen. &lsquo;Keep nothing of mine,&rsquo; said Ameera. &lsquo;Take no hair from my head.
      SHE would make thee burn it later on. That flame I should feel. Lower!
      Stoop lower! Remember only that I was thine and bore thee a son. Though
      thou wed a white woman to-morrow, the pleasure of receiving in thy arms
      thy first son is taken from thee for ever. Remember me when thy son is
      born&mdash;the one that shall carry thy name before all men. His
      misfortunes be on my head. I bear witness&mdash;I bear witness&rsquo;&mdash;the
      lips were forming the words on his ear&mdash;&lsquo;that there is no God but&mdash;thee,
      beloved!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she died. Holden sat still, and all thought was taken from him,&mdash;till
      he heard Ameera&rsquo;s mother lift the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she dead, sahib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will mourn, and afterwards take an inventory of the furniture in
      this house. For that will be mine. The sahib does not mean to resume it?
      It is so little, so very little, sahib, and I am an old woman. I would
      like to lie softly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the mercy of God be silent a while. Go out and mourn where I cannot
      hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sahib, she will be buried in four hours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the custom. I shall go ere she is taken away. That matter is in
      thy hands. Look to it, that the bed on which&mdash;on which she lies&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! That beautiful red-lacquered bed. I have long desired&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That the bed is left here untouched for my disposal. All else in the
      house is thine. Hire a cart, take everything, go hence, and before sunrise
      let there be nothing in this house but that which I have ordered thee to
      respect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am an old woman. I would stay at least for the days of mourning, and
      the rains have just broken. Whither shall I go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that to me? My order is that there is a going. The house-gear is
      worth a thousand rupees and my orderly shall bring thee a hundred rupees
      to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is very little. Think of the cart-hire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be nothing unless thou goest, and with speed. O woman, get hence
      and leave me with my dead!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother shuffled down the staircase, and in her anxiety to take stock
      of the house-fittings forgot to mourn. Holden stayed by Ameera&rsquo;s side and
      the rain roared on the roof. He could not think connectedly by reason of
      the noise, though he made many attempts to do so. Then four sheeted ghosts
      glided dripping into the room and stared at him through their veils. They
      were the washers of the dead. Holden left the room and went out to his
      horse. He had come in a dead, stifling calm through ankle-deep dust. He
      found the courtyard a rain-lashed pond alive with frogs; a torrent of
      yellow water ran under the gate, and a roaring wind drove the bolts of the
      rain like buckshot against the mud-walls. Pir Khan was shivering in his
      little hut by the gate, and the horse was stamping uneasily in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been told the sahib&rsquo;s order,&rsquo; said Pir Khan. &lsquo;It is well. This
      house is now desolate. I go also, for my monkey-face would be a reminder
      of that which has been. Concerning the bed, I will bring that to thy house
      yonder in the morning; but remember, sahib, it will be to thee a knife
      turning in a green wound. I go upon a pilgrimage, and I will take no
      money. I have grown fat in the protection of the Presence whose sorrow is
      my sorrow. For the last time I hold his stirrup.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched Holden&rsquo;s foot with both hands and the horse sprang out into the
      road, where the creaking bamboos were whipping the sky and all the frogs
      were chuckling. Holden could not see for the rain in his face. He put his
      hands before his eyes and muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh you brute! You utter brute!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of his trouble was already in his bungalow. He read the knowledge
      in his butler&rsquo;s eyes when Ahmed Khan brought in food, and for the first
      and last time in his life laid a hand upon his master&rsquo;s shoulder, saying,
      &lsquo;Eat, sahib, eat. Meat is good against sorrow. I also have known. Moreover
      the shadows come and go, sahib; the shadows come and go. These be curried
      eggs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden could neither eat nor sleep. The heavens sent down eight inches of
      rain in that night and washed the earth clean. The waters tore down walls,
      broke roads, and scoured open the shallow graves on the Mahomedan
      burying-ground. All next day it rained, and Holden sat still in his house
      considering his sorrow. On the morning of the third day he received a
      telegram which said only, &lsquo;Ricketts, Myndonie. Dying. Holden relieve.
      Immediate.&rsquo; Then he thought that before he departed he would look at the
      house wherein he had been master and lord. There was a break in the
      weather, and the rank earth steamed with vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that the rains had torn down the mud pillars of the gateway, and
      the heavy wooden gate that had guarded his life hung lazily from one
      hinge. There was grass three inches high in the courtyard; Pir Khan&rsquo;s
      lodge was empty, and the sodden thatch sagged between the beams. A gray
      squirrel was in possession of the verandah, as if the house had been
      untenanted for thirty years instead of three days. Ameera&rsquo;s mother had
      removed everything except some mildewed matting. The tick-tick of the
      little scorpions as they hurried across the floor was the only sound in
      the house. Ameera&rsquo;s room and the other one where Tota had lived were heavy
      with mildew; and the narrow staircase leading to the roof was streaked and
      stained with rain-borne mud. Holden saw all these things, and came out
      again to meet in the road Durga Dass, his landlord,&mdash;portly, affable,
      clothed in white muslin, and driving a Cee-spring buggy. He was
      overlooking his property to see how the roofs stood the stress of the
      first rains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you will not take this place any more, sahib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I shall let it again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will keep it on while I am away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Durga Dass was silent for some time. &lsquo;You shall not take it on, sahib,&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;When I was a young man I also&mdash;, but to-day I am a member of
      the Municipality. Ho! Ho! No. When the birds have gone what need to keep
      the nest? I will have it pulled down&mdash;the timber will sell for
      something always. It shall be pulled down, and the Municipality shall make
      a road across, as they desire, from the burning-ghat to the city wall, so
      that no man may say where this house stood.&rsquo;

      AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The sky is lead and our faces are red,
 And the gates of Hell are opened and riven,
 And the winds of Hell are loosened and driven,
 And the dust flies up in the face of Heaven,
 And the clouds come down in a fiery sheet,
 Heavy to raise and hard to be borne.
 And the soul of man is turned from his meat,
 Turned from the trifles for which he has striven
 Sick in his body, and heavy hearted,
 And his soul flies up like the dust in the sheet
 Breaks from his flesh and is gone and departed,
 As the blasts they blow on the cholera-horn.
                            HIMALAYAN.
</pre>
    <p>
      Four men, each entitled to &lsquo;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,&rsquo; 
      sat at a table playing whist. The thermometer marked&mdash;for them&mdash;one
      hundred and one degrees of heat. The room was darkened till it was only
      just possible to distinguish the pips of the cards and the very white
      faces of the players. A tattered, rotten punkah of whitewashed calico was
      puddling the hot air and whining dolefully at each stroke. Outside lay
      gloom of a November day in London. There was neither sky, sun, nor
      horizon,&mdash;nothing but a brown purple haze of heat. It was as though
      the earth were dying of apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time clouds of tawny dust rose from the ground without wind
      or warning, flung themselves tablecloth-wise among the tops of the parched
      trees, and came down again. Then a whirling dust-devil would scutter
      across the plain for a couple of miles, break, and fall outward, though
      there was nothing to check its flight save a long low line of piled
      railway-sleepers white with the dust, a cluster of huts made of mud,
      condemned rails, and canvas, and the one squat four-roomed bungalow that
      belonged to the assistant engineer in charge of a section of the Gaudhari
      State line then under construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four, stripped to the thinnest of sleeping-suits, played whist
      crossly, with wranglings as to leads and returns. It was not the best kind
      of whist, but they had taken some trouble to arrive at it. Mottram of the
      Indian Survey had ridden thirty and railed one hundred miles from his
      lonely post in the desert since the night before; Lowndes of the Civil
      Service, on special duty in the political department, had come as far to
      escape for an instant the miserable intrigues of an impoverished native
      State whose king alternately fawned and blustered for more money from the
      pitiful revenues contributed by hard-wrung peasants and despairing
      camel-breeders; Spurstow, the doctor of the line, had left a
      cholera-stricken camp of coolies to look after itself for forty-eight
      hours while he associated with white men once more. Hummil, the assistant
      engineer, was the host. He stood fast and received his friends thus every
      Sunday if they could come in. When one of them failed to appear, he would
      send a telegram to his last address, in order that he might know whether
      the defaulter were dead or alive. There are very many places in the East
      where it is not good or kind to let your acquaintances drop out of sight
      even for one short week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players were not conscious of any special regard for each other. They
      squabbled whenever they met; but they ardently desired to meet, as men
      without water desire to drink. They were lonely folk who understood the
      dread meaning of loneliness. They were all under thirty years of age,&mdash;which
      is too soon for any man to possess that knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pilsener?&rsquo; said Spurstow, after the second rubber, mopping his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beer&rsquo;s out, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, and there&rsquo;s hardly enough soda-water for
      to-night,&rsquo; said Hummil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What filthy bad management!&rsquo; Spurstow snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ve written and wired; but the trains don&rsquo;t come through
      regularly yet. Last week the ice ran out,&mdash;as Lowndes knows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glad I didn&rsquo;t come. I could ha&rsquo; sent you some if I had known, though.
      Phew! it&rsquo;s too hot to go on playing bumblepuppy.&rsquo; This with a savage scowl
      at Lowndes, who only laughed. He was a hardened offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mottram rose from the table and looked out of a chink in the shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a sweet day!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company yawned all together and betook themselves to an aimless
      investigation of all Hummil&rsquo;s possessions,&mdash;guns, tattered novels,
      saddlery, spurs, and the like. They had fingered them a score of times
      before, but there was really nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Got anything fresh?&rsquo; said Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last week&rsquo;s Gazette of India, and a cutting from a home paper. My father
      sent it out. It&rsquo;s rather amusing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of those vestrymen that call &lsquo;emselves M.P.&lsquo;s again, is it?&rsquo; said
      Spurstow, who read his newspapers when he could get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Listen to this. It&rsquo;s to your address, Lowndes. The man was making a
      speech to his constituents, and he piled it on. Here&rsquo;s a sample: &ldquo;And I
      assert unhesitatingly that the Civil Service in India is the preserve&mdash;the
      pet preserve&mdash;of the aristocracy of England. What does the democracy&mdash;what
      do the masses&mdash;get from that country, which we have step by step
      fraudulently annexed? I answer, nothing whatever. It is farmed with a
      single eye to their own interests by the scions of the aristocracy. They
      take good care to maintain their lavish scale of incomes, to avoid or
      stifle any inquiries into the nature and conduct of their administration,
      while they themselves force the unhappy peasant to pay with the sweat of
      his brow for all the luxuries in which they are lapped.&rdquo;&rsquo; Hummil waved the
      cutting above his head. &lsquo;&rsquo;Ear! &lsquo;ear!&rsquo; said his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lowndes, meditatively: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give&mdash;I&rsquo;d give three months&rsquo; pay to
      have that gentleman spend one month with me and see how the free and
      independent native prince works things. Old Timbersides&rsquo;&mdash;this was
      his flippant title for an honoured and decorated feudatory prince&mdash;&lsquo;has
      been wearing my life out this week past for money. By Jove, his latest
      performance was to send me one of his women as a bribe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good for you! Did you accept it?&rsquo; said Mottram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I rather wish I had, now. She was a pretty little person, and she
      yarned away to me about the horrible destitution among the king&rsquo;s
      women-folk. The darlings haven&rsquo;t had any new clothes for nearly a month,
      and the old man wants to buy a new drag from Calcutta,&mdash;solid silver
      railings and silver lamps, and trifles of that kind. I&rsquo;ve tried to make
      him understand that he has played the deuce with the revenues for the last
      twenty years and must go slow. He can&rsquo;t see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he has the ancestral treasure-vaults to draw on. There must be three
      millions at least in jewels and coin under his palace,&rsquo; said Hummil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catch a native king disturbing the family treasure! The priests forbid it
      except as the last resort. Old Timbersides has added something like a
      quarter of a million to the deposit in his reign.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where the mischief does it all come from?&rsquo; said Mottram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The country. The state of the people is enough to make you sick. I&rsquo;ve
      known the tax-men wait by a milch-camel till the foal was born and then
      hurry off the mother for arrears. And what can I do? I can&rsquo;t get the court
      clerks to give me any accounts; I can&rsquo;t raise anything more than a fat
      smile from the commander-in-chief when I find out the troops are three
      months in arrears; and old Timbersides begins to weep when I speak to him.
      He has taken to the King&rsquo;s Peg heavily,&mdash;liqueur brandy for whisky,
      and Heidsieck for soda-water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what the Rao of Jubela took to. Even a native can&rsquo;t last long at
      that,&rsquo; said Spurstow. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll go out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a good thing, too. Then I suppose we&rsquo;ll have a council of regency,
      and a tutor for the young prince, and hand him back his kingdom with ten
      years&rsquo; accumulations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whereupon that young prince, having been taught all the vices of the
      English, will play ducks and drakes with the money and undo ten years&rsquo; 
      work in eighteen months. I&rsquo;ve seen that business before,&rsquo; said Spurstow.
      &lsquo;I should tackle the king with a light hand, if I were you, Lowndes.
      They&rsquo;ll hate you quite enough under any circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well. The man who looks on can talk about the light hand;
      but you can&rsquo;t clean a pig-stye with a pen dipped in rose-water. I know my
      risks; but nothing has happened yet. My servant&rsquo;s an old Pathan, and he
      cooks for me. They are hardly likely to bribe him, and I don&rsquo;t accept food
      from my true friends, as they call themselves. Oh, but it&rsquo;s weary work!
      I&rsquo;d sooner be with you, Spurstow. There&rsquo;s shooting near your camp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you? I don&rsquo;t think it. About fifteen deaths a day don&rsquo;t incite a
      man to shoot anything but himself. And the worst of it is that the poor
      devils look at you as though you ought to save them. Lord knows, I&rsquo;ve
      tried everything. My last attempt was empirical, but it pulled an old man
      through. He was brought to me apparently past hope, and I gave him gin and
      Worcester sauce with cayenne. It cured him; but I don&rsquo;t recommend it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do the cases run generally?&rsquo; said Hummil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very simply indeed. Chlorodyne, opium pill, chlorodyne, collapse, nitre,
      bricks to the feet, and then&mdash;the burning-ghat. The last seems to be
      the only thing that stops the trouble. It&rsquo;s black cholera, you know. Poor
      devils! But, I will say, little Bunsee Lal, my apothecary, works like a
      demon. I&rsquo;ve recommended him for promotion if he comes through it all
      alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what are your chances, old man?&rsquo; said Mottram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know; don&rsquo;t care much; but I&rsquo;ve sent the letter in. What are you
      doing with yourself generally?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sitting under a table in the tent and spitting on the sextant to keep it
      cool,&rsquo; said the man of the survey. &lsquo;Washing my eyes to avoid ophthalmia,
      which I shall certainly get, and trying to make a sub-surveyor understand
      that an error of five degrees in an angle isn&rsquo;t quite so small as it
      looks. I&rsquo;m altogether alone, y&rsquo; know, and shall be till the end of the hot
      weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hummil&rsquo;s the lucky man,&rsquo; said Lowndes, flinging himself into a long
      chair. &lsquo;He has an actual roof&mdash;torn as to the ceiling-cloth, but
      still a roof&mdash;over his head. He sees one train daily. He can get beer
      and soda-water and ice &lsquo;em when God is good. He has books, pictures,&mdash;-they
      were torn from the Graphic,&mdash;&lsquo;and the society of the excellent
      sub-contractor Jevins, besides the pleasure of receiving us weekly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummil smiled grimly. &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m the lucky man, I suppose. Jevins is
      luckier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? Not&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Went out. Last Monday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By his own hand?&rsquo; said Spurstow quickly, hinting the suspicion that was
      in everybody&rsquo;s mind. There was no cholera near Hummil&rsquo;s section. Even
      fever gives a man at least a week&rsquo;s grace, and sudden death generally
      implied self-slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I judge no man this weather,&rsquo; said Hummil. &lsquo;He had a touch of the sun, I
      fancy; for last week, after you fellows had left, he came into the
      verandah and told me that he was going home to see his wife, in Market
      Street, Liverpool, that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I got the apothecary in to look at him, and we tried to make him lie
      down. After an hour or two he rubbed his eyes and said he believed he had
      had a fit,&mdash;hoped he hadn&rsquo;t said anything rude. Jevins had a great
      idea of bettering himself socially. He was very like Chucks in his
      language.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he went to his own bungalow and began cleaning a rifle. He told the
      servant that he was going to shoot buck in the morning. Naturally he
      fumbled with the trigger, and shot himself through the head&mdash;accidentally.
      The apothecary sent in a report to my chief, and Jevins is buried
      somewhere out there. I&rsquo;d have wired to you, Spurstow, if you could have
      done anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a queer chap,&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d killed the man yourself you
      couldn&rsquo;t have been more quiet about the business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Lord! what does it matter?&rsquo; said Hummil calmly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do a
      lot of his overseeing work in addition to my own. I&rsquo;m the only person that
      suffers. Jevins is out of it,&mdash;by pure accident, of course, but out
      of it. The apothecary was going to write a long screed on suicide. Trust a
      babu to drivel when he gets the chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let it go in as suicide?&rsquo; said Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No direct proof. A man hasn&rsquo;t many privileges in this country, but he
      might at least be allowed to mishandle his own rifle. Besides, some day I
      may need a man to smother up an accident to myself. Live and let live. Die
      and let die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You take a pill,&rsquo; said Spurstow, who had been watching Hummil&rsquo;s white
      face narrowly. &lsquo;Take a pill, and don&rsquo;t be an ass. That sort of talk is
      skittles. Anyhow, suicide is shirking your work. If I were Job ten times
      over, I should be so interested in what was going to happen next that I&rsquo;d
      stay on and watch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve lost that curiosity,&rsquo; said Hummil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Liver out of order?&rsquo; said Lowndes feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. Can&rsquo;t sleep. That&rsquo;s worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove, it is!&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m that way every now and then, and the
      fit has to wear itself out. What do you take for it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing. What&rsquo;s the use? I haven&rsquo;t had ten minutes&rsquo; sleep since Friday
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor chap! Spurstow, you ought to attend to this,&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;Now you
      mention it, your eyes are rather gummy and swollen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurstow, still watching Hummil, laughed lightly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll patch him up,
      later on. Is it too hot, do you think, to go for a ride?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; said Lowndes wearily. &lsquo;We shall have to go away at eight, and
      there&rsquo;ll be riding enough for us then. I hate a horse, when I have to use
      him as a necessity. Oh, heavens! what is there to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Begin whist again, at chick points [&lsquo;a chick&rsquo; is supposed to be eight
      shillings] and a gold mohur on the rub,&rsquo; said Spurstow promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poker. A month&rsquo;s pay all round for the pool,&mdash;no limit,&mdash;and
      fifty-rupee raises. Somebody would be broken before we got up,&rsquo; said
      Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that it would give me any pleasure to break any man in this
      company,&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t enough excitement in it, and it&rsquo;s
      foolish.&rsquo; He crossed over to the worn and battered little camp-piano,&mdash;wreckage
      of a married household that had once held the bungalow,&mdash;and opened
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s used up long ago,&rsquo; said Hummil. &lsquo;The servants have picked it to
      pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano was indeed hopelessly out of order, but Mottram managed to bring
      the rebellious notes into a sort of agreement, and there rose from the
      ragged keyboard something that might once have been the ghost of a popular
      music-hall song. The men in the long chairs turned with evident interest
      as Mottram banged the more lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rsquo; said Lowndes. &lsquo;By Jove! the last time I heard that song was
      in &lsquo;79, or thereabouts, just before I came out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Spurstow with pride,&rsquo; I was home in &lsquo;80.&rsquo; And he mentioned a
      song of the streets popular at that date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mottram executed it roughly. Lowndes criticised and volunteered
      emendations. Mottram dashed into another ditty, not of the music-hall
      character, and made as if to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said Hummil. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you had any music in your
      composition. Go on playing until you can&rsquo;t think of anything more. I&rsquo;ll
      have that piano tuned up before you come again. Play something festive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very simple indeed were the tunes to which Mottram&rsquo;s art and the
      limitations of the piano could give effect, but the men listened with
      pleasure, and in the pauses talked all together of what they had seen or
      heard when they were last at home. A dense dust-storm sprung up outside,
      and swept roaring over the house, enveloping it in the choking darkness of
      midnight, but Mottram continued unheeding, and the crazy tinkle reached
      the ears of the listeners above the flapping of the tattered
      ceiling-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence after the storm he glided from the more directly personal
      songs of Scotland, half humming them as he played, into the Evening Hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sunday,&rsquo; said he, nodding his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on. Don&rsquo;t apologise for it,&rsquo; said Spurstow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummil laughed long and riotously. &lsquo;Play it, by all means. You&rsquo;re full of
      surprises to-day. I didn&rsquo;t know you had such a gift of finished sarcasm.
      How does that thing go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mottram took up the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too slow by half. You miss the note of gratitude,&rsquo; said Hummil. &lsquo;It ought
      to go to the &ldquo;Grasshopper&rsquo;s Polka,&rdquo;&mdash;this way.&rsquo; And he chanted,
      prestissimo,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Glory to thee, my God, this night. For all the blessings of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      That shows we really feel our blessings. How does it go on?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If in the night I sleepless lie, My soul with sacred thoughts supply; May
      no ill dreams disturb my rest.&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quicker, Mottram!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or powers of darkness me molest!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah! what an old hypocrite you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass,&rsquo; said Lowndes. &lsquo;You are at full liberty to make fun of
      anything else you like, but leave that hymn alone. It&rsquo;s associated in my
      mind with the most sacred recollections&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Summer evenings in the country,&mdash;stained-glass window,&mdash;light
      going out, and you and she jamming your heads together over one
      hymn-book,&rsquo; said Mottram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and a fat old cockchafer hitting you in the eye when you walked
      home. Smell of hay, and a moon as big as a bandbox sitting on the top of a
      haycock; bats,&mdash;roses,&mdash;milk and midges,&rsquo; said Lowndes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Also mothers. I can just recollect my mother singing me to sleep with
      that when I was a little chap,&rsquo; said Spurstow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness had fallen on the room. They could hear Hummil squirming in
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consequently,&rsquo; said he testily, &lsquo;you sing it when you are seven fathom
      deep in Hell! It&rsquo;s an insult to the intelligence of the Deity to pretend
      we&rsquo;re anything but tortured rebels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take TWO pills,&rsquo; said Spurstow; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s tortured liver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The usually placid Hummil is in a vile bad temper. I&rsquo;m sorry for his
      coolies to-morrow,&rsquo; said Lowndes, as the servants brought in the lights
      and prepared the table for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were settling into their places about the miserable goat-chops,
      and the smoked tapioca pudding, Spurstow took occasion to whisper to
      Mottram, &lsquo;Well done, David!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look after Saul, then,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you two whispering about?&rsquo; said Hummil suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only saying that you are a damned poor host. This fowl can&rsquo;t be cut,&rsquo; 
      returned Spurstow with a sweet smile. &lsquo;Call this a dinner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. You don&rsquo;t expect a banquet, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout that meal Hummil contrived laboriously to insult directly and
      pointedly all his guests in succession, and at each insult Spurstow kicked
      the aggrieved persons under the table; but he dared not exchange a glance
      of intelligence with either of them. Hummil&rsquo;s face was white and pinched,
      while his eyes were unnaturally large. No man dreamed for a moment of
      resenting his savage personalities, but as soon as the meal was over they
      made haste to get away. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go. You&rsquo;re just getting amusing, you
      fellows. I hope I haven&rsquo;t said anything that annoyed you. You&rsquo;re such
      touchy devils.&rsquo; Then, changing the note into one of almost abject
      entreaty, Hummil added, &lsquo;I say, you surely aren&rsquo;t going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the language of the blessed Jorrocks, where I dines I sleeps,&rsquo; said
      Spurstow. &lsquo;I want to have a look at your coolies to-morrow, if you don&rsquo;t
      mind. You can give me a place to lie down in, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The others pleaded the urgency of their several duties next day, and,
      saddling up, departed together, Hummil begging them to come next Sunday.
      As they jogged off, Lowndes unbosomed himself to Mottram&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... And I never felt so like kicking a man at his own table in my life.
      He said I cheated at whist, and reminded me I was in debt! &lsquo;Told you you
      were as good as a liar to your face! You aren&rsquo;t half indignant enough over
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;Poor devil! Did you ever know old Hummy behave
      like that before or within a hundred miles of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse. Spurstow was hacking my shin all the time, so I kept a
      hand on myself. Else I should have&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d have done as Hummy did about Jevins; judge no man
      this weather. By Jove! the buckle of my bridle is hot in my hand! Trot out
      a bit, and &lsquo;ware rat-holes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes&rsquo; trotting jerked out of Lowndes one very sage remark when he
      pulled up, sweating from every pore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Good thing Spurstow&rsquo;s with him to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye-es. Good man, Spurstow. Our roads turn here. See you again next
      Sunday, if the sun doesn&rsquo;t bowl me over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;S&rsquo;pose so, unless old Timbersides&rsquo; finance minister manages to dress some
      of my food. Good-night, and&mdash;God bless you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing.&rsquo; Lowndes gathered up his whip, and, as he flicked Mottram&rsquo;s
      mare on the flank, added, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad little chap,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rsquo; And the mare bolted half a mile across the sand, on the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the assistant engineer&rsquo;s bungalow Spurstow and Hummil smoked the pipe
      of silence together, each narrowly watching the other. The capacity of a
      bachelor&rsquo;s establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple. A
      servant cleared away the dining-room table, brought in a couple of rude
      native bedsteads made of tape strung on a light wood frame, flung a square
      of cool Calcutta matting over each, set them side by side, pinned two
      towels to the punkah so that their fringes should just sweep clear of the
      sleepers&rsquo; nose and mouth, and announced that the couches were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men flung themselves down, ordering the punkah-coolies by all the
      powers of Hell to pull. Every door and window was shut, for the outside
      air was that of an oven. The atmosphere within was only 104 degrees, as
      the thermometer bore witness, and heavy with the foul smell of
      badly-trimmed kerosene lamps; and this stench, combined with that of
      native tobacco, baked brick, and dried earth, sends the heart of many a
      strong man down to his boots, for it is the smell of the Great Indian
      Empire when she turns herself for six months into a house of torment.
      Spurstow packed his pillows craftily so that he reclined rather than lay,
      his head at a safe elevation above his feet. It is not good to sleep on a
      low pillow in the hot weather if you happen to be of thick-necked build,
      for you may pass with lively snores and gugglings from natural sleep into
      the deep slumber of heat-apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pack your pillows,&rsquo; said the doctor sharply, as he saw Hummil preparing
      to lie down at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night-light was trimmed; the shadow of the punkah wavered across the
      room, and the &lsquo;flick&rsquo; of the punkah-towel and the soft whine of the rope
      through the wall-hole followed it. Then the punkah flagged, almost ceased.
      The sweat poured from Spurstow&rsquo;s brow. Should he go out and harangue the
      coolie? It started forward again with a savage jerk, and a pin came out of
      the towels. When this was replaced, a tomtom in the coolie-lines began to
      beat with the steady throb of a swollen artery inside some brain-fevered
      skull. Spurstow turned on his side and swore gently. There was no movement
      on Hummil&rsquo;s part. The man had composed himself as rigidly as a corpse, his
      hands clinched at his sides. The respiration was too hurried for any
      suspicion of sleep. Spurstow looked at the set face. The jaws were
      clinched, and there was a pucker round the quivering eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s holding himself as tightly as ever he can,&rsquo; thought Spurstow. &lsquo;What
      in the world is the matter with him?&mdash;Hummil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; in a thick constrained voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you get to sleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Head hot? &lsquo;Throat feeling bulgy? or how?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither, thanks. I don&rsquo;t sleep much, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feel pretty bad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty bad, thanks. There is a tomtom outside, isn&rsquo;t there? I thought it
      was my head at first.... Oh, Spurstow, for pity&rsquo;s sake give me something
      that will put me asleep,&mdash;sound asleep,&mdash;if it&rsquo;s only for six
      hours!&rsquo; He sprang up, trembling from head to foot. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to
      sleep naturally for days, and I can&rsquo;t stand it!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor old chap!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s no use. Give me something to make me sleep. I tell you I&rsquo;m nearly
      mad. I don&rsquo;t know what I say half my time. For three weeks I&rsquo;ve had to
      think and spell out every word that has come through my lips before I
      dared say it. Isn&rsquo;t that enough to drive a man mad? I can&rsquo;t see things
      correctly now, and I&rsquo;ve lost my sense of touch. My skin aches&mdash;my
      skin aches! Make me sleep. Oh, Spurstow, for the love of God make me sleep
      sound. It isn&rsquo;t enough merely to let me dream. Let me sleep!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, old man, all right. Go slow; you aren&rsquo;t half as bad as you
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The flood-gates of reserve once broken, Hummil was clinging to him like a
      frightened child. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re pinching my arm to pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll break your neck if you don&rsquo;t do something for me. No, I didn&rsquo;t mean
      that. Don&rsquo;t be angry, old fellow.&rsquo; He wiped the sweat off himself as he
      fought to regain composure. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a bit restless and off my oats, and
      perhaps you could recommend some sort of sleeping mixture,&mdash;bromide
      of potassium.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bromide of skittles! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this before? Let go of my
      arm, and I&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s anything in my cigarette-case to suit your
      complaint.&rsquo; Spurstow hunted among his day-clothes, turned up the lamp,
      opened a little silver cigarette-case, and advanced on the expectant
      Hummil with the daintiest of fairy squirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The last appeal of civilisation,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and a thing I hate to use.
      Hold out your arm. Well, your sleeplessness hasn&rsquo;t ruined your muscle; and
      what a thick hide it is! Might as well inject a buffalo subcutaneously.
      Now in a few minutes the morphia will begin working. Lie down and wait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile of unalloyed and idiotic delight began to creep over Hummil&rsquo;s
      face. &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he whispered,&mdash;&lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m going off now. Gad! it&rsquo;s
      positively heavenly! Spurstow, you must give me that case to keep; you&mdash;&rsquo; 
      The voice ceased as the head fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for a good deal,&rsquo; said Spurstow to the unconscious form. &lsquo;And now, my
      friend, sleeplessness of your kind being very apt to relax the moral fibre
      in little matters of life and death, I&rsquo;ll just take the liberty of spiking
      your guns.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paddled into Hummil&rsquo;s saddle-room in his bare feet and uncased a
      twelve-bore rifle, an express, and a revolver. Of the first he unscrewed
      the nipples and hid them in the bottom of a saddlery-case; of the second
      he abstracted the lever, kicking it behind a big wardrobe. The third he
      merely opened, and knocked the doll-head bolt of the grip up with the heel
      of a riding-boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s settled,&rsquo; he said, as he shook the sweat off his hands. &lsquo;These
      little precautions will at least give you time to turn. You have too much
      sympathy with gun-room accidents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he rose from his knees, the thick muffled voice of Hummil cried in
      the doorway, &lsquo;You fool!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such tones they use who speak in the lucid intervals of delirium to their
      friends a little before they die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurstow started, dropping the pistol. Hummil stood in the doorway,
      rocking with helpless laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was awf&rsquo;ly good of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; he said, very slowly, feeling for
      his words. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to go out by my own hand at present. I say,
      Spurstow, that stuff won&rsquo;t work. What shall I do? What shall I do?&rsquo; And
      panic terror stood in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lie down and give it a chance. Lie down at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t. It will only take me half-way again, and I shan&rsquo;t be able to
      get away this time. Do you know it was all I could do to come out just
      now? Generally I am as quick as lightning; but you had clogged my feet. I
      was nearly caught.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, I understand. Go and lie down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t delirium; but it was an awfully mean trick to play on me. Do
      you know I might have died?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a sponge rubs a slate clean, so some power unknown to Spurstow had
      wiped out of Hummil&rsquo;s face all that stamped it for the face of a man, and
      he stood at the doorway in the expression of his lost innocence. He had
      slept back into terrified childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he going to die on the spot?&rsquo; thought Spurstow. Then, aloud, &lsquo;All
      right, my son. Come back to bed, and tell me all about it. You couldn&rsquo;t
      sleep; but what was all the rest of the nonsense?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A place,&mdash;a place down there,&rsquo; said Hummil, with simple sincerity.
      The drug was acting on him by waves, and he was flung from the fear of a
      strong man to the fright of a child as his nerves gathered sense or were
      dulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God! I&rsquo;ve been afraid of it for months past, Spurstow. It has made
      every night hell to me; and yet I&rsquo;m not conscious of having done anything
      wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be still, and I&rsquo;ll give you another dose. We&rsquo;ll stop your nightmares, you
      unutterable idiot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but you must give me so much that I can&rsquo;t get away. You must make me
      quite sleepy,&mdash;not just a little sleepy. It&rsquo;s so hard to run then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it; I know it. I&rsquo;ve felt it myself. The symptoms are exactly as
      you describe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t laugh at me, confound you! Before this awful sleeplessness came
      to me I&rsquo;ve tried to rest on my elbow and put a spur in the bed to sting me
      when I fell back. Look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove! the man has been rowelled like a horse! Ridden by the nightmare
      with a vengeance! And we all thought him sensible enough. Heaven send us
      understanding! You like to talk, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sometimes. Not when I&rsquo;m frightened. THEN I want to run. Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always. Before I give you your second dose try to tell me exactly what
      your trouble is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummil spoke in broken whispers for nearly ten minutes, whilst Spurstow
      looked into the pupils of his eyes and passed his hand before them once or
      twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the narrative the silver cigarette-case was produced, and
      the last words that Hummil said as he fell back for the second time were,
      &lsquo;Put me quite to sleep; for if I&rsquo;m caught I die,&mdash;I die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes; we all do that sooner or later,&mdash;thank Heaven who has set
      a term to our miseries,&rsquo; said Spurstow, settling the cushions under the
      head. &lsquo;It occurs to me that unless I drink something I shall go out before
      my time. I&rsquo;ve stopped sweating, and&mdash;I wear a seventeen-inch collar.&rsquo; 
      He brewed himself scalding hot tea, which is an excellent remedy against
      heat-apoplexy if you take three or four cups of it in time. Then he
      watched the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A blind face that cries and can&rsquo;t wipe its eyes, a blind face that chases
      him down corridors! H&rsquo;m! Decidedly, Hummil ought to go on leave as soon as
      possible; and, sane or otherwise, he undoubtedly did rowel himself most
      cruelly. Well, Heaven send us understanding!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At mid-day Hummil rose, with an evil taste in his mouth, but an unclouded
      eye and a joyful heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was pretty bad last night, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen healthier men. You must have had a touch of the sun. Look
      here: if I write you a swingeing medical certificate, will you apply for
      leave on the spot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? You want it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but I can hold on till the weather&rsquo;s a little cooler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you, if you can get relieved on the spot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Burkett is the only man who could be sent; and he&rsquo;s a born fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, never mind about the line. You aren&rsquo;t so important as all that. Wire
      for leave, if necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummil looked very uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can hold on till the Rains,&rsquo; he said evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t. Wire to headquarters for Burkett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t. If you want to know why, particularly, Burkett is married, and
      his wife&rsquo;s just had a kid, and she&rsquo;s up at Simla, in the cool, and Burkett
      has a very nice billet that takes him into Simla from Saturday to Monday.
      That little woman isn&rsquo;t at all well. If Burkett was transferred she&rsquo;d try
      to follow him. If she left the baby behind she&rsquo;d fret herself to death. If
      she came,&mdash;and Burkett&rsquo;s one of those selfish little beasts who are
      always talking about a wife&rsquo;s place being with her husband,&mdash;she&rsquo;d
      die. It&rsquo;s murder to bring a woman here just now. Burkett hasn&rsquo;t the
      physique of a rat. If he came here he&rsquo;d go out; and I know she hasn&rsquo;t any
      money, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;d go out too. I&rsquo;m salted in a sort of way,
      and I&rsquo;m not married. Wait till the Rains, and then Burkett can get thin
      down here. It&rsquo;ll do him heaps of good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to say that you intend to face&mdash;what you have faced,
      till the Rains break?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t be so bad, now you&rsquo;ve shown me a way out of it. I can always
      wire to you. Besides, now I&rsquo;ve once got into the way of sleeping, it&rsquo;ll be
      all right. Anyhow, I shan&rsquo;t put in for leave. That&rsquo;s the long and the
      short of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My great Scott! I thought all that sort of thing was dead and done with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bosh! You&rsquo;d do the same yourself. I feel a new man, thanks to that
      cigarette-case. You&rsquo;re going over to camp now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but I&rsquo;ll try to look you up every other day, if I can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not bad enough for that. I don&rsquo;t want you to bother. Give the coolies
      gin and ketchup.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you feel all right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fit to fight for my life, but not to stand out in the sun talking to you.
      Go along, old man, and bless you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hummil turned on his heel to face the echoing desolation of his bungalow,
      and the first thing he saw standing in the verandah was the figure of
      himself. He had met a similar apparition once before, when he was
      suffering from overwork and the strain of the hot weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is bad,&mdash;already,&rsquo; he said, rubbing his eyes. &lsquo;If the thing
      slides away from me all in one piece, like a ghost, I shall know it is
      only my eyes and stomach that are out of order. If it walks&mdash;my head
      is going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the figure, which naturally kept at an unvarying distance
      from him, as is the use of all spectres that are born of overwork. It slid
      through the house and dissolved into swimming specks within the eyeball as
      soon as it reached the burning light of the garden. Hummil went about his
      business till even. When he came in to dinner he found himself sitting at
      the table. The vision rose and walked out hastily. Except that it cast no
      shadow it was in all respects real.
    </p>
    <p>
      No living man knows what that week held for Hummil. An increase of the
      epidemic kept Spurstow in camp among the coolies, and all he could do was
      to telegraph to Mottram, bidding him go to the bungalow and sleep there.
      But Mottram was forty miles away from the nearest telegraph, and knew
      nothing of anything save the needs of the survey till he met, early on
      Sunday morning, Lowndes and Spurstow heading towards Hummil&rsquo;s for the
      weekly gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hope the poor chap&rsquo;s in a better temper,&rsquo; said the former, swinging
      himself off his horse at the door. &lsquo;I suppose he isn&rsquo;t up yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just have a look at him,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;If he&rsquo;s asleep there&rsquo;s
      no need to wake him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And an instant later, by the tone of Spurstow&rsquo;s voice calling upon them to
      enter, the men knew what had happened. There was no need to wake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punkah was still being pulled over the bed, but Hummil had departed
      this life at least three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body lay on its back, hands clinched by the side, as Spurstow had seen
      it lying seven nights previously. In the staring eyes was written terror
      beyond the expression of any pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mottram, who had entered behind Lowndes, bent over the dead and touched
      the forehead lightly with his lips. &lsquo;Oh, you lucky, lucky devil!&rsquo; he
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lowndes had seen the eyes, and withdrew shuddering to the other side
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor chap! poor old chap! And the last time I met him I was angry.
      Spurstow, we should have watched him. Has he&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Deftly Spurstow continued his investigations, ending by a search round the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he snapped. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no trace of anything. Call the
      servants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came, eight or ten of them, whispering and peering over each other&rsquo;s
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did your Sahib go to bed?&rsquo; said Spurstow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At eleven or ten, we think,&rsquo; said Hummil&rsquo;s personal servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was well then? But how should you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was not ill, as far as our comprehension extended. But he had slept
      very little for three nights. This I know, because I saw him walking much,
      and specially in the heart of the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Spurstow was arranging the sheet, a big straight-necked hunting-spur
      tumbled on the ground. The doctor groaned. The personal servant peeped at
      the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think, Chuma?&rsquo; said Spurstow, catching the look on the dark
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven-born, in my poor opinion, this that was my master has descended
      into the Dark Places, and there has been caught because he was not able to
      escape with sufficient speed. We have the spur for evidence that he fought
      with Fear. Thus have I seen men of my race do with thorns when a spell was
      laid upon them to overtake them in their sleeping hours and they dared not
      sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chuma, you&rsquo;re a mud-head. Go out and prepare seals to be set on the
      Sahib&rsquo;s property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God has made the Heaven-born. God has made me. Who are we, to inquire
      into the dispensations of God? I will bid the other servants hold aloof
      while you are reckoning the tale of the Sahib&rsquo;s property. They are all
      thieves, and would steal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As far as I can make out, he died from&mdash;oh, anything; stoppage of
      the heart&rsquo;s action, heat-apoplexy, or some other visitation,&rsquo; said
      Spurstow to his companions. &lsquo;We must make an inventory of his effects, and
      so on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was scared to death,&rsquo; insisted Lowndes. &lsquo;Look at those eyes! For
      pity&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let him be buried with them open!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever it was, he&rsquo;s clear of all the trouble now,&rsquo; said Mottram softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spurstow was peering into the open eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Can you see anything there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t face it!&rsquo; whimpered Lowndes. &lsquo;Cover up the face! Is there any
      fear on earth that can turn a man into that likeness? It&rsquo;s ghastly. Oh,
      Spurstow, cover it up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fear&mdash;on earth,&rsquo; said Spurstow. Mottram leaned over his shoulder
      and looked intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see nothing except some gray blurs in the pupil. There can be nothing
      there, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so. Well, let&rsquo;s think. It&rsquo;ll take half a day to knock up any sort of
      coffin; and he must have died at midnight. Lowndes, old man, go out and
      tell the coolies to break ground next to Jevins&rsquo;s grave. Mottram, go round
      the house with Chuma and see that the seals are put on things. Send a
      couple of men to me here, and I&rsquo;ll arrange.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong-armed servants when they returned to their own kind told a
      strange story of the doctor Sahib vainly trying to call their master back
      to life by magic arts,&mdash;to wit, the holding of a little green box
      that clicked to each of the dead man&rsquo;s eyes, and of a bewildered muttering
      on the part of the doctor Sahib, who took the little green box away with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resonant hammering of a coffin-lid is no pleasant thing to hear, but
      those who have experience maintain that much more terrible is the soft
      swish of the bed-linen, the reeving and unreeving of the bed-tapes, when
      he who has fallen by the roadside is apparelled for burial, sinking
      gradually as the tapes are tied over, till the swaddled shape touches the
      floor and there is no protest against the indignity of hasty disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last moment Lowndes was seized with scruples of conscience. &lsquo;Ought
      you to read the service,&mdash;from beginning to end?&rsquo; said he to
      Spurstow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I intend to. You&rsquo;re my senior as a civilian. You can take it if you
      like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that for a moment. I only thought if we could get a
      chaplain from somewhere,&mdash;I&rsquo;m willing to ride anywhere,&mdash;and
      give poor Hummil a better chance. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bosh!&rsquo; said Spurstow, as he framed his lips to the tremendous words that
      stand at the head of the burial service.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they smoked a pipe in silence to the memory of the dead.
      Then Spurstow said absently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t in medical science.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things in a dead man&rsquo;s eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake leave that horror alone!&rsquo; said Lowndes. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a
      native die of pure fright when a tiger chivied him. I know what killed
      Hummil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deuce you do! I&rsquo;m going to try to see.&rsquo; And the doctor retreated into
      the bath-room with a Kodak camera. After a few minutes there was the sound
      of something being hammered to pieces, and he emerged, very white indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got a picture?&rsquo; said Mottram. &lsquo;What does the thing look like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was impossible, of course. You needn&rsquo;t look, Mottram. I&rsquo;ve torn up the
      films. There was nothing there. It was impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said Lowndes, very distinctly, watching the shaking hand striving
      to relight the pipe, &lsquo;is a damned lie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mottram laughed uneasily. &lsquo;Spurstow&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re all in such
      a state now that we&rsquo;d believe anything. For pity&rsquo;s sake let&rsquo;s try to be
      rational.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no further speech for a long time. The hot wind whistled
      without, and the dry trees sobbed. Presently the daily train, winking
      brass, burnished steel, and spouting steam, pulled up panting in the
      intense glare. &lsquo;We&rsquo;d better go on on that,&rsquo; said Spurstow. &lsquo;Go back to
      work. I&rsquo;ve written my certificate. We can&rsquo;t do any more good here, and
      work&rsquo;ll keep our wits together. Come on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No one moved. It is not pleasant to face railway journeys at mid-day in
      June. Spurstow gathered up his hat and whip, and, turning in the doorway,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be Heaven,&mdash;there must be Hell. Meantime, there is our
      life here. We-ell?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Mottram nor Lowndes had any answer to the question.

    <p>
      When three obscure gentlemen in San Francisco argued on insufficient
      premises they condemned a fellow-creature to a most unpleasant death in a
      far country, which had nothing whatever to do with the United States. They
      foregathered at the top of a tenement-house in Tehama Street, an unsavoury
      quarter of the city, and, there calling for certain drinks, they conspired
      because they were conspirators by trade, officially known as the Third
      Three of the I.A.A.&mdash;an institution for the propagation of pure
      light, not to be confounded with any others, though it is affiliated to
      many. The Second Three live in Montreal, and work among the poor there;
      the First Three have their home in New York, not far from Castle Garden,
      and write regularly once a week to a small house near one of the big
      hotels at Boulogne. What happens after that, a particular section of
      Scotland Yard knows too well, and laughs at. A conspirator detests
      ridicule. More men have been stabbed with Lucrezia Borgia daggers and
      dropped into the Thames for laughing at Head Centres and Triangles than
      for betraying secrets; for this is human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Third Three conspired over whisky cocktails and a clean sheet of
      notepaper against the British Empire and all that lay therein. This work
      is very like what men without discernment call politics before a general
      election. You pick out and discuss, in the company of congenial friends,
      all the weak points in your opponents&rsquo; organisation, and unconsciously
      dwell upon and exaggerate all their mishaps, till it seems to you a
      miracle that the hated party holds together for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our principle is not so much active demonstration&mdash;that we leave to
      others&mdash;as passive embarrassment, to weaken and unnerve,&rsquo; said the
      first man. &lsquo;Wherever an organisation is crippled, wherever a confusion is
      thrown into any branch of any department, we gain a step for those who
      take on the work; we are but the forerunners.&rsquo; He was a German enthusiast,
      and editor of a newspaper, from whose leading articles he quoted
      frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That cursed Empire makes so many blunders of her own that unless we
      doubled the year&rsquo;s average I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t strike her anything special
      had occurred,&rsquo; said the second man. &lsquo;Are you prepared to say that all our
      resources are equal to blowing off the muzzle of a hundred-ton gun or
      spiking a ten-thousand-ton ship on a plain rock in clear daylight? They
      can beat us at our own game. &lsquo;Better join hands with the practical
      branches; we&rsquo;re in funds now. Try a direct scare in a crowded street. They
      value their greasy hides.&rsquo; He was the drag upon the wheel, and an
      Americanised Irishman of the second generation, despising his own race and
      hating the other. He had learned caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third man drank his cocktail and spoke no word. He was the strategist,
      but unfortunately his knowledge of life was limited. He picked a letter
      from his breast-pocket and threw it across the table. That epistle to the
      heathen contained some very concise directions from the First Three in New
      York. It said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boom in black iron has already affected the eastern markets, where
      our agents have been forcing down the English-held stock among the smaller
      buyers who watch the turn of shares. Any immediate operations, such as
      western bears, would increase their willingness to unload. This, however,
      cannot be expected till they see clearly that foreign iron-masters are
      witting to co-operate. Mulcahy should be dispatched to feel the pulse of
      the market, and act accordingly. Mavericks are at present the best for our
      purpose.&mdash;P.D.Q.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a message referring to an iron crisis in Pennsylvania, it was
      interesting, if not lucid. As a new departure in organised attack on an
      outlying English dependency, it was more than interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second man read it through and murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Already? Surely they are in too great a hurry. All that Dhulip Singh
      could do in India he has done, down to the distribution of his photographs
      among the peasantry. Ho! Ho! The Paris firm arranged that, and he has no
      substantial money backing from the Other Power. Even our agents in India
      know he hasn&rsquo;t. What is the use of our organisation wasting men on work
      that is already done? Of course the Irish regiments in India are half
      mutinous as they stand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows how near a lie may come to the truth. An Irish regiment, for
      just so long as it stands still, is generally a hard handful to control,
      being reckless and rough. When, however, it is moved in the direction of
      musketry-firing, it becomes strangely and unpatriotically content with its
      lot. It has even been heard to cheer the Queen with enthusiasm on these
      occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the notion of tampering with the army was, from the point of view of
      Tehama Street, an altogether sound one. There is no shadow of stability in
      the policy of an English Government, and the most sacred oaths of England
      would, even if engrossed on vellum, find very few buyers among colonies
      and dependencies that have suffered from vain beliefs. But there remains
      to England always her army. That cannot change except in the matter of
      uniform and equipment. The officers may write to the papers demanding the
      heads of the Horse Guards in default of cleaner redress for grievances;
      the men may break loose across a country town and seriously startle the
      publicans; but neither officers nor men have it in their composition to
      mutiny after the continental manner. The English people, when they trouble
      to think about the army at all, are, and with justice, absolutely assured
      that it is absolutely trustworthy. Imagine for a moment their emotions on
      realising that such and such a regiment was in open revolt from causes
      directly due to England&rsquo;s management of Ireland. They would probably send
      the regiment to the polls forthwith and examine their own consciences as
      to their duty to Erin; but they would never be easy any more. And it was
      this vague, unhappy mistrust that the I. A. A. were labouring to produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sheer waste of breath,&rsquo; said the second man after a pause in the council,
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of tampering with their fool-army, but it has been
      tried before and we must try it again. It looks well in the reports. If we
      send one man from here you may bet your life that other men are going too.
      Order up Mulcahy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They ordered him up&mdash;a slim, slight, dark-haired young man, devoured
      with that blind rancorous hatred of England that only reaches its full
      growth across the Atlantic. He had sucked it from his mother&rsquo;s breast in
      the little cabin at the back of the northern avenues of New York; he had
      been taught his rights and his wrongs, in German and Irish, on the canal
      fronts of Chicago; and San Francisco held men who told him strange and
      awful things of the great blind power over the seas. Once, when business
      took him across the Atlantic, he had served in an English regiment, and
      being insubordinate had suffered extremely. He drew all his ideas of
      England that were not bred by the cheaper patriotic prints from one
      iron-fisted colonel and an unbending adjutant. He would go to the mines if
      need be to teach his gospel. And he went as his instructions advised
      p.d.q.&mdash;which means &lsquo;with speed&rsquo;&mdash;to introduce embarrassment
      into an Irish regiment, &lsquo;already half-mutinous, quartered among Sikh
      peasantry, all wearing miniatures of His Highness Dhulip Singh, Maharaja
      of the Punjab, next their hearts, and all eagerly expecting his arrival.&rsquo; 
      Other information equally valuable was given him by his masters. He was to
      be cautious, but never to grudge expense in winning the hearts of the men
      in the regiment. His mother in New York would supply funds, and he was to
      write to her once a month. Life is pleasant for a man who has a mother in
      New York to send him two hundred pounds a year over and above his
      regimental pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In process of time, thanks to his intimate knowledge of drill and musketry
      exercise, the excellent Mulcahy, wearing the corporal&rsquo;s stripe, went out
      in a troopship and joined Her Majesty&rsquo;s Royal Loyal Musketeers, commonly
      known as the &lsquo;Mavericks,&rsquo; because they were masterless and unbranded
      cattle-sons of small farmers in County Clare, shoeless vagabonds of Kerry,
      herders of Bally-vegan, much wanted &lsquo;moonlighters&rsquo; from the bare rainy
      headlands of the south coast, officered by O&rsquo;Mores, Bradys, Hills,
      Kilreas, and the like. Never to outward seeming was there more promising
      material to work on. The First Three had chosen their regiment well. It
      feared nothing that moved or talked save the colonel and the regimental
      Roman Catholic chaplain, the fat Father Dennis, who held the keys of
      heaven and hell, and blared like an angry bull when he desired to be
      convincing. Him also it loved because on occasions of stress he was used
      to tuck up his cassock and charge with the rest into the merriest of the
      fray, where he always found, good man, that the saints sent him a revolver
      when there was a fallen private to be protected, or&mdash;but this came as
      an afterthought&mdash;his own gray head to be guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cautiously as he had been instructed, tenderly and with much beer, Mulcahy
      opened his projects to such as he deemed fittest to listen. And these
      were, one and all, of that quaint, crooked, sweet, profoundly
      irresponsible and profoundly lovable race that fight like fiends, argue
      like children, reason like women, obey like men, and jest like their own
      goblins of the rath through rebellion, loyalty, want, woe, or war. The
      underground work of a conspiracy is always dull and very much the same the
      world over. At the end of six months&mdash;the seed always falling on good
      ground&mdash;Mulcahy spoke almost explicitly, hinting darkly in the
      approved fashion at dread powers behind him, and advising nothing more nor
      less than mutiny. Were they not dogs, evilly treated? had they not all
      their own and their national revenges to satisfy? Who in these days would
      do aught to nine hundred men in rebellion? Who, again, could stay them if
      they broke for the sea, licking up on their way other regiments only too
      anxious to join? And afterwards... here followed windy promises of gold
      and preferment, office, and honour, ever dear to a certain type of
      Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he finished his speech, in the dusk of a twilight, to his chosen
      associates, there was a sound of a rapidly unslung belt behind him. The
      arm of one Dan Grady flew out in the gloom and arrested something. Then
      said Dan&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mulcahy, you&rsquo;re a great man, an&rsquo; you do credit to whoever sent you. Walk
      about a bit while we think of it.&rsquo; Mulcahy departed elate. He knew his
      words would sink deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the triple-dashed asterisks did ye not let me belt him?&rsquo; grunted a
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m not a fat-headed fool. Boys, &lsquo;tis what he&rsquo;s been driving at
      these six months&mdash;our superior corpril with his education and his
      copies of the Irish papers and his everlasting beer. He&rsquo;s been sent for
      the purpose and that&rsquo;s where the money comes from. Can ye not see? That
      man&rsquo;s a gold-mine, which Horse Egan here would have destroyed with a
      belt-buckle. It would be throwing away the gifts of Providence not to fall
      in with his little plans. Of coorse we&rsquo;ll mut&rsquo;ny till all&rsquo;s dry. Shoot the
      colonel on the parade-ground, massacree the company officers, ransack the
      arsenal, and then&mdash;Boys, did he tell you what next? He told me the
      other night when he was beginning to talk wild. Then we&rsquo;re to join with
      the niggers, and look for help from Dhulip Singh and the Russians!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And spoil the best campaign that ever was this side of Hell! Danny, I&rsquo;d
      have lost the beer to ha&rsquo; given him the belting he requires.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, let him go this awhile, man! He&rsquo;s got no&mdash;no constructiveness,
      but that&rsquo;s the egg-meat of his plan, and you must understand that I&rsquo;m in
      with it, an&rsquo; so are you. We&rsquo;ll want oceans of beer to convince us&mdash;firmaments
      full. We&rsquo;ll give him talk for his money, and one by one all the boys &lsquo;ll
      come in and he&rsquo;ll have a nest of nine hundred mutineers to squat in an&rsquo; 
      give drink to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What makes me killing-mad is his wanting us to do what the niggers did
      thirty years gone. That an&rsquo; his pig&rsquo;s cheek in saying that other regiments
      would come along,&rsquo; said a Kerry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not so bad as hintin&rsquo; we should loose off on the colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel be sugared! I&rsquo;d as soon as not put a shot through his helmet to
      see him jump and clutch his old horse&rsquo;s head. But Mulcahy talks o&rsquo; 
      shootin&rsquo; our comp&rsquo;ny orf&rsquo;cers accidental.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said that, did he?&rsquo; said Horse Egan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somethin&rsquo; like that, anyways. Can&rsquo;t ye fancy ould Barber Brady wid a
      bullet in his lungs, coughin&rsquo; like a sick monkey, an&rsquo; sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Bhoys, I do
      not mind your gettin&rsquo; dhrunk, but you must hould your liquor like men. The
      man that shot me is dhrunk. I&rsquo;ll suspend investigations for six hours,
      while I get this bullet cut out, an&rsquo; then&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; then,&rsquo; continued Horse Egan, for the peppery Major&rsquo;s peculiarities of
      speech and manner were as well known as his tanned face; &ldquo;&lsquo;an&rsquo; then, ye
      dissolute, half-baked, putty-faced scum o&rsquo; Connemara, if I find a man so
      much as lookin&rsquo; confused, begad, I&rsquo;ll coort-martial the whole company. A
      man that can&rsquo;t get over his liquor in six hours is not fit to belong to
      the Mavericks!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout of laughter bore witness to the truth of the sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s pretty to think of,&rsquo; said the Kerry man slowly. &lsquo;Mulcahy would have
      us do all the devilmint, and get clear himself, someways. He wudn&rsquo;t be
      takin&rsquo; all this fool&rsquo;s throuble in shpoilin&rsquo; the reputation of the
      regiment&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reputation of your grandmother&rsquo;s pig!&rsquo; said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, an&rsquo; HE had a good reputation tu; so it&rsquo;s all right. Mulcahy must
      see his way to clear out behind him, or he&rsquo;d not ha&rsquo; come so far, talkin&rsquo; 
      powers of darkness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear anything of a regimental court-martial among the Black
      Boneens, these days? Half a company of &lsquo;em took one of the new draft an&rsquo; 
      hanged him by his arms with a tent-rope from a third story verandah. They
      gave no reason for so doin&rsquo;, but he was half dead. I&rsquo;m thinking that the
      Boneens are short-sighted. It was a friend of Mulcahy&rsquo;s, or a man in the
      same trade. They&rsquo;d a deal better ha&rsquo; taken his beer,&rsquo; returned Dan
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better still ha&rsquo; handed him up to the Colonel,&rsquo; said Horse Egan, &lsquo;onless&mdash;but
      sure the news wud be all over the counthry an&rsquo; give the reg&rsquo;ment a bad
      name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;d be no reward for that man&mdash;he but went about talkin&rsquo;,&rsquo; 
      said the Kerry man artlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak by your breed,&rsquo; said Dan with a laugh. &lsquo;There was never a Kerry
      man yet that wudn&rsquo;t sell his brother for a pipe o&rsquo; tobacco an&rsquo; a pat on
      the back from a p&rsquo;liceman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Praise God I&rsquo;m not a bloomin&rsquo; Orangeman,&rsquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor never will be,&rsquo; said Dan. &lsquo;They breed MEN in Ulster. Would you
      like to thry the taste of one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kerry man looked and longed, but forbore. The odds of battle were too
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ll not even give Mulcahy a&mdash;a strike for his money,&rsquo; said
      the voice of Horse Egan, who regarded what he called &lsquo;trouble&rsquo; of any kind
      as the pinnacle of felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan answered not at all, but crept on tip-toe, with large strides, to the
      mess-room, the men following. The room was empty. In a corner, cased like
      the King of Dahomey&rsquo;s state umbrella, stood the regimental Colours. Dan
      lifted them tenderly and unrolled in the light of the candles the record
      of the Mavericks&mdash;tattered, worn, and hacked. The white satin was
      darkened everywhere with big brown stains, the gold threads on the crowned
      harp were frayed and discoloured, and the Red Bull, the totem of the
      Mavericks, was coffee-hued. The stiff, embroidered folds, whose price is
      human life, rustled down slowly. The Mavericks keep their colours long and
      guard them very sacredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vittoria, Salamanca, Toulouse, Waterloo, Moodkee, Ferozshah, an&rsquo; Sobraon&mdash;that
      was fought close next door here, against the very beggars he wants us to
      join. Inkermann, The Alma, Sebastopol! What are those little businesses
      compared to the campaigns of General Mulcahy? The Mut&rsquo;ny, think o&rsquo; that;
      the Mut&rsquo;ny an&rsquo; some dirty little matters in Afghanistan; an&rsquo; for that an&rsquo; 
      these an&rsquo; those&rsquo;&mdash;Dan pointed to the names of glorious battles&mdash;&lsquo;that
      Yankee man with the partin&rsquo; in his hair comes an&rsquo; says as easy as &ldquo;have a
      drink.&rdquo;... Holy Moses, there&rsquo;s the captain!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the mess-sergeant who came in just as the men clattered out,
      and found the colours uncased.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day dated the mutiny of the Mavericks, to the joy of Mulcahy and
      the pride of his mother in New York&mdash;the good lady who sent the money
      for the beer. Never, so far as words went, was such a mutiny. The
      conspirators, led by Dan Grady and Horse Egan, poured in daily. They were
      sound men, men to be trusted, and they all wanted blood; but first they
      must have beer. They cursed the Queen, they mourned over Ireland, they
      suggested hideous plunder of the Indian country side, and then, alas&mdash;some
      of the younger men would go forth and wallow on the ground in spasms of
      wicked laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genius of the Irish for conspiracies is remarkable. None the less they
      would swear no oaths but those of their own making, which were rare and
      curious, and they were always at pains to impress Mulcahy with the risks
      they ran. Naturally the flood of beer wrought demoralisation. But Mulcahy
      confused the causes of things, and when a very muzzy Maverick smote a
      sergeant on the nose or called his commanding officer a bald-headed old
      lard-bladder and even worse names, he fancied that rebellion and not
      liquor was at the bottom of the outbreak. Other gentlemen who have
      concerned themselves in larger conspiracies have made the same error.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot season, in which they protested no man could rebel, came to an
      end, and Mulcahy suggested a visible return for his teachings. As to the
      actual upshot of the mutiny he cared nothing. It would be enough if the
      English, infatuatedly trusting to the integrity of their army, should be
      startled with news of an Irish regiment revolting from political
      considerations. His persistent demands would have ended, at Dan&rsquo;s
      instigation, in a regimental belting which in all probability would have
      killed him and cut off the supply of beer, had not he been sent on special
      duty some fifty miles away from the cantonment to cool his heels in a mud
      fort and dismount obsolete artillery. Then the colonel of the Mavericks,
      reading his newspaper diligently, and scenting Frontier trouble from afar,
      posted to the army headquarters and pled with the Commander-in-chief for
      certain privileges, to be granted under certain contingencies; which
      contingencies came about only a week later, when the annual little war on
      the border developed itself and the colonel returned to carry the good
      news to the Mavericks. He held the promise of the Chief for active
      service, and the men must get ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the same day, Mulcahy, an unconsidered corporal&mdash;yet
      great in conspiracy&mdash;returned to cantonments, and heard sounds of
      strife and howlings from afar off. The mutiny had broken out and the
      barracks of the Mavericks were one white-washed pandemonium. A private
      tearing through the barrack-square, gasped in his ear, &lsquo;Service! Active
      service. It&rsquo;s a burnin&rsquo; shame.&rsquo; Oh joy, the Mavericks had risen on the eve
      of battle! They would not&mdash;noble and loyal sons of Ireland&mdash;serve
      the Queen longer. The news would flash through the country side and over
      to England, and he&mdash;Mulcahy&mdash;the trusted of the Third Three, had
      brought about the crash. The private stood in the middle of the square and
      cursed colonel, regiment, officers, and doctor, particularly the doctor,
      by his gods. An orderly of the native cavalry regiment clattered through
      the mob of soldiers. He was half lifted, half dragged from his horse,
      beaten on the back with mighty hand-claps till his eyes watered, and
      called all manner of endearing names. Yes, the Mavericks had fraternised
      with the native troops. Who then was the agent among the latter that had
      blindly wrought with Mulcahy so well?
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer slunk, almost ran, from the mess to a barrack. He was mobbed by
      the infuriated soldiery, who closed round but did not kill him, for he
      fought his way to shelter, flying for the life. Mulcahy could have wept
      with pure joy and thankfulness. The very prisoners in the guard-room were
      shaking the bars of their cells and howling like wild beasts, and from
      every barrack poured the booming as of a big war-drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy hastened to his own barrack. He could hardly hear himself speak.
      Eighty men were pounding with fist and heel the tables and trestles&mdash;eighty
      men, flushed with mutiny, stripped to their shirt sleeves, their knapsacks
      half-packed for the march to the sea, made the two-inch boards thunder
      again as they chanted to a tune that Mulcahy knew well, the Sacred War
      Song of the Mavericks&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Listen in the north, my boys, there&rsquo;s trouble on the wind;
     Tramp o&rsquo; Cossack hooves in front, gray great-coats behind,
     Trouble on the Frontier of a most amazin&rsquo; kind,
       Trouble on the waters o&rsquo; the Oxus!
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, as a table broke under the furious accompaniment&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hurrah! hurrah! it&rsquo;s north by west we go;
     Hurrah! hurrah! the chance we wanted so;
     Let &lsquo;em hear the chorus from Umballa to MosCOW,
     As we go marchin&rsquo; to the Kremling.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother of all the saints in bliss and all the devils in cinders, where&rsquo;s
      my fine new sock widout the heel?&rsquo; howled Horse Egan, ransacking
      everybody&rsquo;s valise but his own. He was engaged in making up deficiencies
      of kit preparatory to a campaign, and in that work he steals best who
      steals last. &lsquo;Ah, Mulcahy, you&rsquo;re in good time,&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got
      the route, and we&rsquo;re off on Thursday for a pic-nic wid the Lancers next
      door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An ambulance orderly appeared with a huge basket full of lint rolls,
      provided by the forethought of the Queen for such as might need them later
      on. Horse Egan unrolled his bandage, and flicked it under Mulcahy&rsquo;s nose,
      chanting&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;Sheepskin an&rsquo; bees&rsquo; wax, thunder, pitch, and plaster,
     The more you try to pull it off, the more it sticks the faster.
     As I was goin&rsquo; to New Orleans&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know the rest of it, my Irish American-Jew boy. By gad, ye have to
      fight for the Queen in the inside av a fortnight, my darlin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of laughter interrupted. Mulcahy looked vacantly down the room. Bid
      a boy defy his father when the pantomime-cab is at the door; or a girl
      develop a will of her own when her mother is putting the last touches to
      the first ball-dress; but do not ask an Irish regiment to embark upon
      mutiny on the eve of a campaign; when it has fraternised with the native
      regiment that accompanies it, and driven its officers into retirement with
      ten thousand clamorous questions, and the prisoners dance for joy, and the
      sick men stand in the open, calling down all known diseases on the head of
      the doctor, who has certified that they are &ldquo;medically unfit for active
      service.&rdquo; At even the Mavericks might have been mistaken for mutineers by
      one so unversed in their natures as Mulcahy. At dawn a girls&rsquo; school might
      have learned deportment from them. They knew that their colonel&rsquo;s hand had
      closed, and that he who broke that iron discipline would not go to the
      front: nothing in the world will persuade one of our soldiers when he is
      ordered to the north on the smallest of affairs that he is not immediately
      going gloriously to slay Cossacks and cook his kettles in the palace of
      the Czar. A few of the younger men mourned for Mulcahy&rsquo;s beer, because the
      campaign was to be conducted on strict temperance principles, but as Dan
      and Horse Egan said sternly, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got the beer-man with us. He shall
      drink now on his own hook.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy had not taken into account the possibility of being sent on active
      service. He had made up his mind that he would not go under any
      circumstances, but fortune was against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sick&mdash;you?&rsquo; said the doctor, who had served an unholy apprenticeship
      to his trade in Tralee poorhouses. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re only home-sick, and what you
      call varicose veins come from over-eating. A little gentle exercise will
      cure that.&rsquo; And later, &lsquo;Mulcahy, my man, everybody is allowed to apply for
      a sick-certificate ONCE. If he tries it twice we call him by an ugly name.
      Go back to your duty, and let&rsquo;s hear no more of your diseases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am ashamed to say that Horse Egan enjoyed the study of Mulcahy&rsquo;s soul in
      those days, and Dan took an equal interest. Together they would
      communicate to their corporal all the dark lore of death which is the
      portion of those who have seen men die. Egan had the larger experience,
      but Dan the finer imagination. Mulcahy shivered when the former spoke of
      the knife as an intimate acquaintance, or the latter dwelt with loving
      particularity on the fate of those who, wounded and helpless, had been
      overlooked by the ambulances, and had fallen into the hands of the Afghan
      women-folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy knew that the mutiny, for the present at least, was dead; knew,
      too, that a change had come over Dan&rsquo;s usually respectful attitude towards
      him, and Horse Egan&rsquo;s laughter and frequent allusions to abortive
      conspiracies emphasised all that the conspirator had guessed. The horrible
      fascination of the death-stories, however, made him seek the men&rsquo;s
      society. He learnt much more than he had bargained for; and in this
      manner: It was on the last night before the regiment entrained to the
      front. The barracks were stripped of everything movable, and the men were
      too excited to sleep. The bare walls gave out a heavy hospital smell of
      chloride of lime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said Mulcahy in an awe-stricken whisper, after some
      conversation on the eternal subject, &lsquo;are you going to do to me, Dan?&rsquo; 
      This might have been the language of an able conspirator conciliating a
      weak spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; said Dan grimly, turning over in his cot, &lsquo;or I rather shud
      say you&rsquo;ll not see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was hardly the language of a weak spirit. Mulcahy shook under the
      bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be easy with him,&rsquo; put in Egan from the next cot. &lsquo;He has got his chanst
      o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; clean. Listen, Mulcahy; all we want is for the good sake of the
      regiment that you take your death standing up, as a man shud. There be
      heaps an&rsquo; heaps of enemy&mdash;plenshus heaps. Go there an&rsquo; do all you can
      and die decent. You&rsquo;ll die with a good name THERE. &lsquo;Tis not a hard thing
      considerin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mulcahy shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An&rsquo; how could a man wish to die better than fightin&rsquo;?&rsquo; added Dan
      consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if I won&rsquo;t?&rsquo; said the corporal in a dry whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be a dale of smoke,&rsquo; returned Dan, sitting up and ticking off
      the situation on his fingers, &lsquo;sure to be, an&rsquo; the noise of the firin&rsquo; &lsquo;ll
      be tremenjus, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be running about up and down, the regiment will.
      But WE, Horse and I&mdash;we&rsquo;ll stay by you, Mulcahy, and never let you
      go. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be an accident.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s playing it low on me. Let me go. For pity&rsquo;s sake let me go. I never
      did you harm, and&mdash;and I stood you as much beer as I could. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      be hard on me, Dan! You are&mdash;you were in it too. You won&rsquo;t kill me up
      there, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not thinkin&rsquo; of the treason; though you shud be glad any honest boys
      drank with you. It&rsquo;s for the regiment. We can&rsquo;t have the shame o&rsquo; you
      bringin&rsquo; shame on us. You went to the doctor quiet as a sick cat to get
      and stay behind an&rsquo; live with the women at the depot&mdash;you that wanted
      us to run to the sea in wolf-packs like the rebels none of your black
      blood dared to be! But WE knew about your goin&rsquo; to the doctor, for he told
      in mess, and it&rsquo;s all over the regiment. Bein&rsquo;, as we are, your best
      friends, we didn&rsquo;t allow any one to molest you YET. We will see to you
      ourselves. Fight which you will&mdash;us or the enemy&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never
      lie in that cot again, and there&rsquo;s more glory and maybe less kicks from
      fightin&rsquo; the enemy. That&rsquo;s fair speakin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he told us by word of mouth to go and join with the niggers&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      forgotten that, Dan,&rsquo; said Horse Egan, to justify sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of plaguin&rsquo; the man? One shot pays for all. Sleep ye
      sound, Mulcahy. But you onderstand, do ye not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mulcahy for some weeks understood very little of anything at all save that
      ever at his elbow, in camp, or at parade, stood two big men with soft
      voices adjuring him to commit hari-kari lest a worse thing should happen&mdash;to
      die for the honour of the regiment in decency among the nearest knives.
      But Mulcahy dreaded death. He remembered certain things that priests had
      said in his infancy, and his mother&mdash;not the one at New York&mdash;starting
      from her sleep with shrieks to pray for a husband&rsquo;s soul in torment. It is
      well to be of a cultured intelligence, but in time of trouble the weak
      human mind returns to the creed it sucked in at the breast, and if that
      creed be not a pretty one trouble follows. Also, the death he would have
      to face would be physically painful. Most conspirators have large
      imaginations. Mulcahy could see himself, as he lay on the earth in the
      night, dying by various causes. They were all horrible; the mother in New
      York was very far away, and the Regiment, the engine that, once you fall
      in its grip, moves you forward whether you will or won&rsquo;t, was daily coming
      closer to the enemy!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were brought to the field of Marzun-Katai, and with the Black Boneens
      to aid, they fought a fight that has never been set down in the
      newspapers. In response, many believe, to the fervent prayers of Father
      Dennis, the enemy not only elected to fight in the open, but made a
      beautiful fight, as many weeping Irish mothers knew later. They gathered
      behind walls or flickered across the open in shouting masses, and were
      pot-valiant in artillery. It was expedient to hold a large reserve and
      wait for the psychological moment that was being prepared by the shrieking
      shrapnel. Therefore the Mavericks lay down in open order on the brow of a
      hill to watch the play till their call should come. Father Dennis, whose
      duty was in the rear, to smooth the trouble of the wounded, had naturally
      managed to make his way to the foremost of his boys and lay like a black
      porpoise, at length on the grass. To him crawled Mulcahy, ashen-gray,
      demanding absolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re shot,&rsquo; said Father Dennis sweetly. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a time for
      everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Grady chuckled as he blew for the fiftieth time into the breech of his
      speckless rifle. Mulcahy groaned and buried his head in his arms till a
      stray shot spoke like a snipe immediately above his head, and a general
      heave and tremour rippled the line. Other shots followed and a few took
      effect, as a shriek or a grunt attested. The officers, who had been lying
      down with the men, rose and began to walk steadily up and down the front
      of their companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manoeuvre, executed, not for publication, but as a guarantee of good
      faith, to soothe men, demands nerve. You must not hurry, you must not look
      nervous, though you know that you are a mark for every rifle within
      extreme range, and above all if you are smitten you must make as little
      noise as possible and roll inwards through the files. It is at this hour,
      when the breeze brings the first salt whiff of the powder to noses rather
      cold at the tip, and the eye can quietly take in the appearance of each
      red casualty, that the strain on the nerves is strongest. Scotch regiments
      can endure for half a day and abate no whit of their zeal at the end;
      English regiments sometimes sulk under punishment, while the Irish, like
      the French, are apt to run forward by ones and twos, which is just as bad
      as running back. The truly wise commandant of highly strung troops allows
      them, in seasons of waiting, to hear the sound of their own voices
      uplifted in song. There is a legend of an English regiment that lay by its
      arms under fire chaunting &lsquo;Sam Hall,&rsquo; to the horror of its newly appointed
      and pious colonel. The Black Boneens, who were suffering more than the
      Mavericks, on a hill half a mile away, began presently to explain to all
      who cared to listen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;ll sound the jubilee, from the centre to the sea, And Ireland shall be
      free, says the Shan-van Vogh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sing, boys,&rsquo; said Father Dennis softly. &lsquo;It looks as if we cared for
      their Afghan peas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Grady raised himself to his knees and opened his mouth in a song
      imparted to him, as to most of his comrades, in the strictest confidence
      by Mulcahy&mdash;-the Mulcahy then lying limp and fainting on the grass,
      the chill fear of death upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Company after company caught up the words which, the I. A. A. say, are to
      herald the general rising of Erin, and to breathe which, except to those
      duly appointed to hear, is death. Wherefore they are printed in this
      place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Saxon in Heaven&rsquo;s just balance is weighed,
       His doom like Belshazzar&rsquo;s in death has been cast,
     And the hand of the venger shall never be stayed
       Till his race, faith, and speech are a dream of the past.
</pre>
    <p>
      They were heart-filling lines and they ran with a swirl; the I. A. A. are
      better served by their pens than their petards. Dan clapped Mulcahy
      merrily on the back, asking him to sing up. The officers lay down again.
      There was no need to walk any more. Their men were soothing themselves
      thunderously, thus&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     St. Mary in Heaven has written the vow
       That the land shall not rest till the heretic blood,
     From the babe at the breast to the hand at the plough,
       Has rolled to the ocean like Shannon in flood!
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to you after all&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; said Father Dennis authoritatively
      in Dan&rsquo;s ear. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of confessing to me when you do this
      foolishness? Dan, you&rsquo;ve been playing with fire! I&rsquo;ll lay you more penance
      in a week than&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along to Purgatory with us, Father dear. The Boneens are on the
      move; they&rsquo;ll let us go now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The regiment rose to the blast of the bugle as one man; but one man there
      was who rose more swiftly than all the others, for half an inch of bayonet
      was in the fleshy part of his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do it,&rsquo; said Dan grimly. &lsquo;Do it decent, anyhow;&rsquo; and the
      roar of the rush drowned his words, for the rear companies thrust forward
      the first, still singing as they swung down the slope&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      From the child at the breast to the hand at the plough Shall roll to the
      ocean like Shannon in flood!
    </p>
    <p>
      They should have sung it in the face of England, not of the Afghans, whom,
      it impressed as much as did the wild Irish yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They came down singing,&rsquo; said the unofficial report of the enemy, borne
      from village to village the next day. &lsquo;They continued to sing, and it was
      written that our men could not abide when they came. It is believed that
      there was magic in the aforesaid song.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan and Horse Egan kept themselves in the neighbourhood of Mulcahy. Twice
      the man would have bolted back in the confusion. Twice he was heaved,
      kicked, and shouldered back again into the unpaintable inferno of a hotly
      contested charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, the panic excess of his fear drove him into madness beyond all
      human courage. His eyes staring at nothing, his mouth open and frothing,
      and breathing as one in a cold bath, he went forward demented, while Dan
      toiled after him. The charge checked at a high mud wall. It was Mulcahy
      who scrambled up tooth and nail and hurled down among the bayonets the
      amazed Afghan who barred his way. It was Mulcahy, keeping to the straight
      line of the rabid dog, who led a collection of ardent souls at a newly
      unmasked battery and flung himself on the muzzle of a gun as his
      companions danced among the gunners. It was Mulcahy who ran wildly on from
      that battery into the open plain, where the enemy were retiring in sullen
      groups. His hands were empty, he had lost helmet and belt, and he was
      bleeding from a wound in the neck. Dan and Horse Egan, panting and
      distressed, had thrown themselves down on the ground by the captured guns,
      when they noticed Mulcahy&rsquo;s charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mad,&rsquo; said Horse Egan critically. &lsquo;Mad with fear! He&rsquo;s going straight to
      his death, an&rsquo; shouting&rsquo;s no use.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him go. Watch now! If we fire we&rsquo;ll hit him, maybe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of a hurrying crowd of Afghans turned at the noise of shod feet
      behind him, and shifted his knife ready to hand. This, he saw, was no time
      to take prisoners. Mulcahy tore on, sobbing; the straight-held blade went
      home through the defenceless breast, and the body pitched forward almost
      before a shot from Dan&rsquo;s rifle brought down the slayer and still further
      hurried the Afghan retreat. The two Irishmen went out to bring in their
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was given the point and that was an easy death,&rsquo; said Horse Egan,
      viewing the corpse. &lsquo;But would you ha&rsquo; shot him, Danny, if he had lived?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t live, so there&rsquo;s no sayin&rsquo;. But I doubt I wud have bekase of
      the fun he gave us&mdash;let alone the beer. Hike up his legs, Horse, and
      we&rsquo;ll bring him in. Perhaps &lsquo;tis better this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They bore the poor limp body to the mass of the regiment, lolling
      open-mouthed on their rifles; and there was a general snigger when one of
      the younger subalterns said, &lsquo;That was a good man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Phew,&rsquo; said Horse Egan, when a burial-party had taken over the burden.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m powerful dhry, and this reminds me there&rsquo;ll be no more beer at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fwhy not?&rsquo; said Dan, with a twinkle in his eye as he stretched himself
      for rest. &lsquo;Are we not conspirin&rsquo; all we can, an&rsquo; while we conspire are we
      not entitled to free dhrinks? Sure his ould mother in New York would not
      let her son&rsquo;s comrades perish of drouth&mdash;if she can be reached at the
      end of a letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a janius,&rsquo; said Horse Egan. &lsquo;O&rsquo; coorse she will not. I wish this
      crool war was over an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d get back to canteen. Faith, the
      Commander-in-Chief ought to be hanged in his own little sword-belt for
      makin&rsquo; us work on wather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mavericks were generally of Horse Egan&rsquo;s opinion. So they made haste
      to get their work done as soon as possible, and their industry was
      rewarded by unexpected peace. &lsquo;We can fight the sons of Adam,&rsquo; said the
      tribesmen, &lsquo;but we cannot fight the sons of Eblis, and this regiment never
      stays still in one place. Let us therefore come in.&rsquo; They came in and
      &lsquo;this regiment&rsquo; withdrew to conspire under the leadership of Dan Grady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent as a subordinate Dan failed altogether as a chief-in-command&mdash;possibly
      because he was too much swayed by the advice of the only man in the
      regiment who could manufacture more than one kind of handwriting. The same
      mail that bore to Mulcahy&rsquo;s mother in New York a letter from the colonel
      telling her how valiantly her son had fought for the Queen, and how
      assuredly he would have been recommended for the Victoria Cross had he
      survived, carried a communication signed, I grieve to say, by that same
      colonel and all the officers of the regiment, explaining their willingness
      to do &lsquo;anything which is contrary to the regulations and all kinds of
      revolutions&rsquo; if only a little money could be forwarded to cover incidental
      expenses. Daniel Grady, Esquire, would receive funds, vice Mulcahy, who
      &lsquo;was unwell at this present time of writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both letters were forwarded from New York to Tehama Street, San Francisco,
      with marginal comments as brief as they were bitter. The Third Three read
      and looked at each other. Then the Second Conspirator-he who believed in
      &lsquo;joining hands with the practical branches&rsquo;&mdash;-began to laugh, and on
      recovering his gravity said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I consider this will be a lesson
      to us. We&rsquo;re left again. Those cursed Irish have let us down. I knew they
      would, but&rsquo;-here he laughed afresh-&rsquo;I&rsquo;d give considerable to know what was
      at the back of it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His curiosity would have been satisfied had he seen Dan Grady, discredited
      regimental conspirator, trying to explain to his thirsty comrades in India
      the non-arrival of funds from New York.

    <h2>
      THE MARK OF THE BEAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your Gods and my Gods-do you or I know which are the stronger? Native
      Proverb.
    </p>
    <p>
      EAST of Suez, some hold, the direct control of Providence ceases; Man
      being there handed over to the power of the Gods and Devils of Asia, and
      the Church of England Providence only exercising an occasional and
      modified supervision in the case of Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory accounts for some of the more unnecessary horrors of life in
      India: it may be stretched to explain my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Strickland of the Police, who knows as much of natives of India
      as is good for any man, can bear witness to the facts of the case.
      Dumoise, our doctor, also saw what Strickland and I saw. The inference
      which he drew from the evidence was entirely incorrect. He is dead now; he
      died, in a rather curious manner, which has been elsewhere described.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Fleete came to India he owned a little money and some land in the
      Himalayas, near a place called Dharmsala. Both properties had been left
      him by an uncle, and he came out to finance them. He was a big, heavy,
      genial, and inoffensive man. His knowledge of natives was, of course,
      limited, and he complained of the difficulties of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode in from his place in the hills to spend New Year in the station,
      and he stayed with Strickland. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve there was a big dinner at
      the club, and the night was excusably wet. When men foregather from the
      uttermost ends of the Empire, they have a right to be riotous. The
      Frontier had sent down a contingent o&rsquo; Catch-&rsquo;em-Alive-O&rsquo;s who had not
      seen twenty white faces for a year, and were used to ride fifteen miles to
      dinner at the next Fort at the risk of a Khyberee bullet where their
      drinks should lie. They profited by their new security, for they tried to
      play pool with a curled-up hedgehog found in the garden, and one of them
      carried the marker round the room in his teeth. Half a dozen planters had
      come in from the south and were talking &lsquo;horse&rsquo; to the Biggest Liar in
      Asia, who was trying to cap all their stories at once. Everybody was
      there, and there was a general closing up of ranks and taking stock of our
      losses in dead or disabled that had fallen during the past year. It was a
      very wet night, and I remember that we sang &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne&rsquo; with our feet
      in the Polo Championship Cup, and our heads among the stars, and swore
      that we were all dear friends. Then some of us went away and annexed
      Burma, and some tried to open up the Soudan and were opened up by Fuzzies
      in that cruel scrub outside Suakim, and some found stars and medals, and
      some were married, which was bad, and some did other things which were
      worse, and the others of us stayed in our chains and strove to make money
      on insufficient experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleete began the night with sherry and bitters, drank champagne steadily
      up to dessert, then raw, rasping Capri with all the strength of whisky,
      took Benedictine with his coffee, four or five whiskies and sodas to
      improve his pool strokes, beer and bones at half-past two, winding up with
      old brandy. Consequently, when he came out, at half-past three in the
      morning, into fourteen degrees of frost, he was very angry with his horse
      for coughing, and tried to leapfrog into the saddle. The horse broke away
      and went to his stables; so Strickland and I formed a Guard of Dishonour
      to take Fleete home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our road lay through the bazaar, close to a little temple of Hanuman, the
      Monkey-god, who is a leading divinity worthy of respect. All gods have
      good points, just as have all priests. Personally, I attach much
      importance to Hanuman, and am kind to his people&mdash;the great gray apes
      of the hills. One never knows when one may want a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in the temple, and as we passed, we could hear voices of
      men chanting hymns. In a native temple, the priests rise at all hours of
      the night to do honour to their god. Before we could stop him, Fleete
      dashed up the steps, patted two priests on the back, and was gravely
      grinding the ashes of his cigar-butt into the forehead of the red stone
      image of Hanuman. Strickland tried to drag him out, but he sat down and
      said solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shee that? &lsquo;Mark of the B-beasht! <i>I</i> made it. Ishn&rsquo;t it fine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In half a minute the temple was alive and noisy, and Strickland, who knew
      what came of polluting gods, said that things might occur. He, by virtue
      of his official position, long residence in the country, and weakness for
      going among the natives, was known to the priests and he felt unhappy.
      Fleete sat on the ground and refused to move. He said that &lsquo;good old
      Hanuman&rsquo; made a very soft pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without any warning, a Silver Man came out of a recess behind the
      image of the god. He was perfectly naked in that bitter, bitter cold, and
      his body shone like frosted silver, for he was what the Bible calls &lsquo;a
      leper as white as snow.&rsquo; Also he had no face, because he was a leper of
      some years&rsquo; standing and his disease was heavy upon him. We two stooped to
      haul Fleete up, and the temple was filling and filling with folk who
      seemed to spring from the earth, when the Silver Man ran in under our
      arms, making a noise exactly like the mewing of an otter, caught Fleete
      round the body and dropped his head on Fleete&rsquo;s breast before we could
      wrench him away. Then he retired to a corner and sat mewing while the
      crowd blocked all the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests were very angry until the Silver Man touched Fleete. That
      nuzzling seemed to sober them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a few minutes&rsquo; silence one of the priests came to Strickland
      and said, in perfect English, &lsquo;Take your friend away. He has done with
      Hanuman, but Hanurnan has not done with him.&rsquo; The crowd gave room and we
      carried Fleete into the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland was very angry. He said that we might all three have been
      knifed, and that Fleete should thank his stars that he had escaped without
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleete thanked no one. He said that he wanted to go to bed. He was
      gorgeously drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved on, Strickland silent and wrathful, until Fleete was taken with
      violent shivering fits and sweating. He said that the smells of the bazaar
      were overpowering, and he wondered why slaughter-houses were permitted so
      near English residences. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you smell the blood?&rsquo; said Fleete.
    </p>
    <p>
      We put him to bed at last, just as the dawn was breaking, and Strickland
      invited me to have another whisky and soda. While we were drinking he
      talked of the trouble in the temple, and admitted that it baffled him
      completely. Strickland hates being mystified by natives, because his
      business in life is to overmatch them with their own weapons. He has not
      yet succeeded in doing this, but in fifteen or twenty years he will have
      made some small progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They should have mauled us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;instead of mewing at us. I wonder
      what they meant. I don&rsquo;t like it one little bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that the Managing Committee of the temple would in all probability
      bring a criminal action against us for insulting their religion. There was
      a section of the Indian Penal Code which exactly met Fleete&rsquo;s offence.
      Strickland said he only hoped and prayed that they would do this. Before I
      left I looked into Fleete&rsquo;s room, and saw him lying on his right side,
      scratching his left breast. Then. I went to bed cold, depressed, and
      unhappy, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock I rode over to Strickland&rsquo;s house to inquire after Fleete&rsquo;s
      head. I imagined that it would be a sore one. Fleete was breakfasting and
      seemed unwell. His temper was gone, for he was abusing the cook for not
      supplying him with an underdone chop. A man who can eat raw meat after a
      wet night is a curiosity. I told Fleete this and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You breed queer mosquitoes in these parts,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been bitten to
      pieces, but only in one place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at the bite,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;It may have gone down
      since this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the chops were being cooked, Fleete opened his shirt and showed us,
      just over his left breast, a mark, the perfect double of the black
      rosettes&mdash;the five or six irregular blotches arranged in a circle&mdash;on
      a leopard&rsquo;s hide. Strickland looked and said, &lsquo;It was only pink this
      morning. It&rsquo;s grown black now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleete ran to a glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; he said,&rsquo; this is nasty. What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not answer. Here the chops came in, all red and juicy, and Fleete
      bolted three in a most offensive manner. He ate on his right grinders
      only, and threw his head over his right shoulder as he snapped the meat.
      When he had finished, it struck him that he had been behaving strangely,
      for he said apologetically, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever felt so hungry in my
      life. I&rsquo;ve bolted like an ostrich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast Strickland said to me, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go. Stay here, and stay for
      the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that my house was not three miles from Strickland&rsquo;s, this request
      was absurd. But Strickland insisted, and was going to say something when
      Fleete interrupted by declaring in a shamefaced way that he felt hungry
      again. Strickland sent a man to my house to fetch over my bedding and a
      horse, and we three went down to Strickland&rsquo;s stables to pass the hours
      until it was time to go out for a ride. The man who has a weakness for
      horses never wearies of inspecting them; and when two men are killing time
      in this way they gather knowledge and lies the one from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were five horses in the stables, and I shall never forget the scene
      as we tried to look them over. They seemed to have gone mad. They reared
      and screamed and nearly tore up their pickets; they sweated and shivered
      and lathered and were distraught with fear. Strickland&rsquo;s horses used to
      know him as well as his dogs; which made the matter more curious. We left
      the stable for fear of the brutes throwing themselves in their panic. Then
      Strickland turned back and called me. The horses were still frightened,
      but they let us &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; and make much of them, and put their heads in our
      bosoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They aren&rsquo;t afraid of US,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;D&rsquo;you know, I&rsquo;d give three
      months&rsquo; pay if OUTRAGE here could talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Outrage was dumb, and could only cuddle up to his master and blow out
      his nostrils, as is the custom of horses when they wish to explain things
      but can&rsquo;t. Fleete came up when we were in the stalls, and as soon as the
      horses saw him, their fright broke out afresh. It was all that we could do
      to escape from the place unkicked. Strickland said, &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to
      love you, Fleete.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Fleete; &lsquo;my mare will follow me like a dog.&rsquo; He went to
      her; she was in a loose-box; but as he slipped the bars she plunged,
      knocked him down, and broke away into the garden. I laughed, but
      Strickland was not amused. He took his moustache in both fists and pulled
      at it till it nearly came out. Fleete, instead of going off to chase his
      property, yawned, saying that he felt sleepy. He went to the house to lie
      down, which was a foolish way of spending New Year&rsquo;s Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland sat with me in the stables and asked if I had noticed anything
      peculiar in Fleete&rsquo;s manner. I said that he ate his food like a beast; but
      that this might have been the result of living alone in the hills out of
      the reach of society as refined and elevating as ours for instance.
      Strickland was not amused. I do not think that he listened to me, for his
      next sentence referred to the mark on Fleete&rsquo;s breast, and I said that it
      might have been caused by blister-flies, or that it was possibly a
      birth-mark newly born and now visible for the first time. We both agreed
      that it was unpleasant to look at, and Strickland found occasion to say
      that I was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what I think now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;because you would call me a
      madman; but you must stay with me for the next few days, if you can. I
      want you to watch Fleete, but don&rsquo;t tell me what you think till I have
      made up my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am dining out to-night,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Strickland, &lsquo;and
      so is Fleete. At least if he doesn&rsquo;t change his mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked about the garden smoking, but saying nothing&mdash;because we
      were friends, and talking spoils good tobacco&mdash;till our pipes were
      out. Then we went to wake up Fleete. He was wide awake and fidgeting about
      his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, I want some more chops,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Can I get them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We laughed and said, &lsquo;Go and change. The ponies will be round in a
      minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Fleete. I&rsquo;ll go when I get the chops&mdash;underdone
      ones, mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be quite in earnest. It was four o&rsquo;clock, and we had had
      breakfast at one; still, for a long time, he demanded those underdone
      chops. Then he changed into riding clothes and went out into the verandah.
      His pony&mdash;the mare had not been caught&mdash;would not let him come
      near. All three horses were unmanageable&mdash;-mad with fear&mdash;-and
      finally Fleete said that he would stay at home and get something to eat.
      Strickland and I rode out wondering. As we passed the temple of Hanuman,
      the Silver Man came out and mewed at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not one of the regular priests of the temple,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;I
      think I should peculiarly like to lay my hands on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no spring in our gallop on the racecourse that evening. The
      horses were stale, and moved as though they had been ridden out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fright after breakfast has been too much for them,&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the only remark he made through the remainder of the ride. Once
      or twice I think he swore to himself; but that did not count.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came back in the dark at seven o&rsquo;clock, and saw that there were no
      lights in the bungalow. &lsquo;Careless ruffians my servants are!&rsquo; said
      Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      My horse reared at something on the carriage drive, and Fleete stood up
      under its nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing, grovelling about the garden?&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But both horses bolted and nearly threw us. We dismounted by the stables
      and returned to Fleete, who was on his hands and knees under the
      orange-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, nothing in the world,&rsquo; said Fleete, speaking very quickly and
      thickly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been gardening-botanising you know. The smell of the earth
      is delightful. I think I&rsquo;m going for a walk-a long walk-all night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that there was something excessively out of order somewhere,
      and I said to Strickland, &lsquo;I am not dining out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless you!&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;Here, Fleete, get up. You&rsquo;ll catch fever
      there. Come in to dinner and let&rsquo;s have the lamps lit. We &lsquo;ll all dine at
      home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleete stood up unwillingly, and said, &lsquo;No lamps-no lamps. It&rsquo;s much nicer
      here. Let&rsquo;s dine outside and have some more chops-lots of &lsquo;em and
      underdone&mdash;bloody ones with gristle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a December evening in Northern India is bitterly cold, and Fleete&rsquo;s
      suggestion was that of a maniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said Strickland sternly. &lsquo;Come in at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleete came, and when the lamps were brought, we saw that he was literally
      plastered with dirt from head to foot. He must have been rolling in the
      garden. He shrank from the light and went to his room. His eyes were
      horrible to look at. There was a green light behind them, not in them, if
      you understand, and the man&rsquo;s lower lip hung down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland said, &lsquo;There is going to be trouble-big trouble-to-night. Don&rsquo;t
      you change your riding-things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited and waited for Fleete&rsquo;s reappearance, and ordered dinner in the
      meantime. We could hear him moving about his own room, but there was no
      light there. Presently from the room came the long-drawn howl of a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      People write and talk lightly of blood running cold and hair standing up
      and things of that kind. Both sensations are too horrible to be trifled
      with. My heart stopped as though a knife had been driven through it, and
      Strickland turned as white as the tablecloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The howl was repeated, and was answered by another howl far across the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      That set the gilded roof on the horror. Strickland dashed into Fleete&rsquo;s
      room. I followed, and we saw Fleete getting out of the window. He made
      beast-noises in the back of his throat. He could not answer us when we
      shouted at him. He spat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t quite remember what followed, but I think that Strickland must
      have stunned him with the long boot-jack or else I should never have been
      able to sit on his chest. Fleete could not speak, he could only snarl, and
      his snarls were those of a wolf, not of a man. The human spirit must have
      been giving way all day and have died out with the twilight. We were
      dealing with a beast that had once been Fleete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair was beyond any human and rational experience. I tried to say
      &lsquo;Hydrophobia,&rsquo; but the word wouldn&rsquo;t come, because I knew that I was
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      We bound this beast with leather thongs of the punkah-rope, and tied its
      thumbs and big toes together, and gagged it with a shoe-horn, which makes
      a very efficient gag if you know how to arrange it. Then we carried it
      into the dining-room, and sent a man to Dumoise, the doctor, telling him
      to come over at once. After we had despatched the messenger and were
      drawing breath, Strickland said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good. This isn&rsquo;t any doctor&rsquo;s
      work.&rsquo; I, also, knew that he spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beast&rsquo;s head was free, and it threw it about from side to side. Any
      one entering the room would have believed that we were curing a wolf&rsquo;s
      pelt. That was the most loathsome accessory of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland sat with his chin in the heel of his fist, watching the beast
      as it wriggled on the ground, but saying nothing. The shirt had been torn
      open in the scuffle and showed the black rosette mark on the left breast.
      It stood out like a blister.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence of the watching we heard something without mewing like a
      she-otter. We both rose to our feet, and, I answer for myself, not
      Strickland, felt sick&mdash;actually and physically sick. We told each
      other, as did the men in Pinafore, that it was the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumoise arrived, and I never saw a little man so unprofessionally shocked.
      He said that it was a heart-rending case of hydrophobia, and that nothing
      could be done. At least any palliative measures would only prolong the
      agony. The beast was foaming at the mouth. Fleete, as we told Dumoise, had
      been bitten by dogs once or twice. Any man who keeps half a dozen terriers
      must expect a nip now and again. Dumoise could offer no help. He could
      only certify that Fleete was dying of hydrophobia. The beast was then
      howling, for it had managed to spit out the shoe-horn. Dumoise said that
      he would be ready to certify to the cause of death, and that the end was
      certain. He was a good little man, and he offered to remain with us; but
      Strickland refused the kindness. He did not wish to poison Dumoise&rsquo;s New
      Year. He would only ask him not to give the real cause of Fleete&rsquo;s death
      to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Dumoise left, deeply agitated; and as soon as the noise of the
      cart-wheels had died away, Strickland told me, in a whisper, his
      suspicions. They were so wildly improbable that he dared not say them out
      aloud; and I, who entertained all Strickland&rsquo;s beliefs, was so ashamed of
      owning to them that I pretended to disbelieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even if the Silver Man had bewtiched Fleete for polluting the image of
      Hanuman, the punishment could not have fallen so quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was whispering this the cry outside the house rose again, and the
      beast fell into a fresh paroxysm of struggling till we were afraid that
      the thongs that held it would give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Watch!&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;If this happens six times I shall take the law
      into my own hands. I order you to help me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into his room and came out in a few minutes with the barrels of an
      old shot-gun, a piece of fishing-line, some thick cord, and his heavy
      wooden bedstead. I reported that the convulsions had followed the cry by
      two seconds in each case, and the beast seemed perceptibly weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland muttered, &lsquo;But he can&rsquo;t take away the life! He can&rsquo;t take away
      the life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, though I knew that I was arguing against myself, &lsquo;It may be a cat.
      It must be a cat. If the Silver Man is responsible, why does he dare to
      come here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland arranged the wood on the hearth, put the gun-barrels into the
      glow of the fire, spread the twine on the table and broke a walking stick
      in two. There was one yard of fishing line, gut, lapped with wire, such as
      is used for mahseer-fishing, and he tied the two ends together in a loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, &lsquo;How can we catch him? He must be taken alive and unhurt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that we must trust in Providence, and go out softly with
      polo-sticks into the shrubbery at the front of the house. The man or
      animal that made the cry was evidently moving round the house as regularly
      as a night-watchman. We could wait in the bushes till he came by and knock
      him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland accepted this suggestion, and we slipped out from a bath-room
      window into the front verandah and then across the carriage drive into the
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moonlight we could see the leper coming round the corner of the
      house. He was perfectly naked, and from time to time he mewed and stopped
      to dance with his shadow. It was an unattractive sight, and thinking of
      poor Fleete, brought to such degradation by so foul a creature, I put away
      all my doubts and resolved to help Strickland from the heated gun-barrels
      to the loop of twine-from the loins to the head and back again&mdash;-with
      all tortures that might be needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leper halted in the front porch for a moment and we jumped out on him
      with the sticks. He was wonderfully strong, and we were afraid that he
      might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him. We had an idea
      that lepers were frail creatures, but this proved to be incorrect.
      Strickland knocked his legs from under him and I put my foot on his neck.
      He mewed hideously, and even through my riding-boots I could feel that his
      flesh was not the flesh of a clean man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck at us with his hand and feet-stumps. We looped the lash of a
      dog-whip round him, under the armpits, and dragged him backwards into the
      hall and so into the dining-room where the beast lay. There we tied him
      with trunk-straps. He made no attempt to escape, but mewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we confronted him with the beast the scene was beyond description.
      The beast doubled backwards into a bow as though he had been poisoned with
      strychnine, and moaned in the most pitiable fashion. Several other things
      happened also, but they cannot be put down here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I was right,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;Now we will ask him to cure this
      case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the leper only mewed. Strickland wrapped a towel round his hand and
      took the gun-barrels out of the fire. I put the half of the broken walking
      stick through the loop of fishing-line and buckled the leper comfortably
      to Strickland&rsquo;s bedstead. I understood then how men and women and little
      children can endure to see a witch burnt alive; for the beast was moaning
      on the floor, and though the Silver Man had no face, you could see
      horrible feelings passing through the slab that took its place, exactly as
      waves of heat play across red-hot iron&mdash;gun-barrels for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland shaded his eyes with his hands for a moment and we got to work.
      This part is not to be printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn was beginning to break when the leper spoke. His mewings had not
      been satisfactory up to that point. The beast had fainted from exhaustion
      and the house was very still. We unstrapped the leper and told him to take
      away the evil spirit. He crawled to the beast and laid his hand upon the
      left breast. That was all. Then he fell face down and whined, drawing in
      his breath as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watched the face of the beast, and saw the soul of Fleete coming back
      into the eyes. Then a sweat broke out on the forehead and the eyes-they
      were human eyes&mdash;-closed. We waited for an hour but Fleete still
      slept. We carried him to his room and bade the leper go, giving him the
      bedstead, and the sheet on the bedstead to cover his nakedness, the gloves
      and the towels with which we had touched him, and the whip that had been
      hooked round his body. He put the sheet about him and went out into the
      early morning without speaking or mewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland wiped his face and sat down. A night-gong, far away in the
      city, made seven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly four-and-twenty hours!&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve done enough to
      ensure my dismissal from the service, besides permanent quarters in a
      lunatic asylum. Do you believe that we are awake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-hot gun-barrel had fallen on the floor and was singeing the
      carpet. The smell was entirely real.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning at eleven we two together went to wake up Fleete. We looked
      and saw that the black leopard-rosette on his chest had disappeared. He
      was very drowsy and tired, but as soon as he saw us, he said, &lsquo;Oh!
      Confound you fellows. Happy New Year to you. Never mix your liquors. I&rsquo;m
      nearly dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks for your kindness, but you&rsquo;re over time,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;To-day
      is the morning of the second. You&rsquo;ve slept the clock round with a
      vengeance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and little Dumoise put his head in. He had come on foot,
      and fancied that we were laving out Fleete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought a nurse,&rsquo; said Dumoise. &lsquo;I suppose that she can come in
      for... what is necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; said Fleete cheerily, sitting up in bed. &lsquo;Bring on your
      nurses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumoise was dumb. Strickland led him out and explained that there must
      have been a mistake in the diagnosis. Dumoise remained dumb and left the
      house hastily. He considered that his professional reputation had been
      injured, and was inclined to make a personal matter of the recovery.
      Strickland went out too. When he came back, he said that he had been to
      call on the Temple of Hanuman to offer redress for the pollution of the
      god, and had been solemnly assured that no white man had ever touched the
      idol and that he was an incarnation of all the virtues labouring under a
      delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &lsquo;&ldquo;There are more things . . .&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Strickland hates that quotation. He says that I have worn it
      threadbare.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other curious thing happened which frightened me as much as anything
      in all the night&rsquo;s work. When Fleete was dressed he came into the
      dining-room and sniffed. He had a quaint trick of moving his nose when he
      sniffed. &lsquo;Horrid doggy smell, here,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You should really keep
      those terriers of yours in better order. Try sulphur, Strick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Strickland did not answer. He caught hold of the back of a chair, and,
      without warning, went into an amazing fit of hysterics. It is terrible to
      see a strong man overtaken with hysteria. Then it struck me that we had
      fought for Fleete&rsquo;s soul with the Silver Man in that room, and had
      disgraced ourselves as Englishmen for ever, and I laughed and gasped and
      gurgled just as shamefully as Strickland, while Fleete thought that we had
      both gone mad. We never told him what we had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years later, when Strickland had married and was a church-going
      member of society for his wife&rsquo;s sake, we reviewed the incident
      dispassionately, and Strickland suggested that I should put it before the
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot myself see that this step is likely to clear up the mystery;
      because, in the first place, no one will believe a rather unpleasant
      story, and, in the second, it is well known to every right-minded man that
      the gods of the heathen are stone and brass, and any attempt to deal with
      them otherwise is justly condemned.

    <h2>
      THE RETURN OF IMRAY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The doors were wide, the story saith,
 Out of the night came the patient wraith,
 He might not speak, and he could not stir
 A hair of the Baron&rsquo;s minniver&mdash;
 Speechless and strengthless, a shadow thin,
 He roved the castle to seek his kin.
 And oh, &rsquo;twas a piteous thing to see
 The dumb ghost follow his enemy!
                             THE BARON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Imray achieved the impossible. Without warning, for no conceivable motive,
      in his youth, at the threshold of his career he chose to disappear from
      the world&mdash;-which is to say, the little Indian station where he
      lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a day he was alive, well, happy, and in great evidence among the
      billiard-tables at his Club. Upon a morning, he was not, and no manner of
      search could make sure where he might be. He had stepped out of his place;
      he had not appeared at his office at the proper time, and his dogcart was
      not upon the public roads. For these reasons, and because he was
      hampering, in a microscopical degree, the administration of the Indian
      Empire, that Empire paused for one microscopical moment to make inquiry
      into the fate of Imray. Ponds were dragged, wells were plumbed, telegrams
      were despatched down the lines of railways and to the nearest seaport
      town-twelve hundred miles away; but Imray was not at the end of the
      drag-ropes nor the telegraph wires. He was gone, and his place knew him no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the work of the great Indian Empire swept forward, because it could
      not be delayed, and Imray from being a man became a mystery&mdash;such a
      thing as men talk over at their tables in the Club for a month, and then
      forget utterly. His guns, horses, and carts were sold to the highest
      bidder. His superior officer wrote an altogether absurd letter to his
      mother, saying that Imray had unaccountably disappeared, and his bungalow
      stood empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by, my
      friend Strickland, of the Police, saw fit to rent the bungalow from the
      native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal&mdash;an
      affair which has been described in another place&mdash;and while he was
      pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was
      sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs.
      There was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for
      meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find at
      the sideboard, and this is not good for human beings. His domestic
      equipment was limited to six rifles, three shot-guns, five saddles, and a
      collection of stiff-jointed mahseer-rods, bigger and stronger than the
      largest salmon-rods. These occupied one-half of his bungalow, and the
      other half was given up to Strickland and his dog Tietjens&mdash;an
      enormous Rampur slut who devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke
      to Strickland in a language of her own; and whenever, walking abroad, she
      saw things calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the
      Queen-Empress, she returned to her master and laid information. Strickland
      would take steps at once, and the end of his labours was trouble and fine
      and imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was
      a familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born
      of hate and fear. One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special
      use. She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking-trough, and if any
      one came into Strickland&rsquo;s room at night her custom was to knock down the
      invader and give tongue till some one came with a light. Strickland owed
      his life to her, when he was on the Frontier, in search of a local
      murderer, who came in the gray dawn to send Strickland much farther than
      the Andaman Islands. Tietjens caught the man as he was crawling into
      Strickland&rsquo;s tent with a dagger between his teeth; and after his record of
      iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged. From that
      date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver, and employed a monogram on
      her night-blanket; and the blanket was of double woven Kashmir cloth, for
      she was a delicate dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under no circumstances would she be separated from Strickland; and once,
      when he was ill with fever, made great trouble for the doctors, because
      she did not know how to help her master and would not allow another
      creature to attempt aid. Macarnaght, of the Indian Medical Service, beat
      her over her head with a gun-butt before she could understand that she
      must give room for those who could give quinine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after Strickland had taken Imray&rsquo;s bungalow, my business took
      me through that Station, and naturally, the Club quarters being full, I
      quartered myself upon Strickland. It was a desirable bungalow,
      eight-roomed and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from rain.
      Under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling-cloth which looked just as neat
      as a white-washed ceiling. The landlord had repainted it when Strickland
      took the bungalow. Unless you knew how Indian bungalows were built you
      would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the dark
      three-cornered cavern of the roof, where the beams and the underside of
      the thatch harboured all manner of rats, bats, ants, and foul things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tietjens met me in the verandah with a bay like the boom of the bell of
      St. Paul&rsquo;s, putting her paws on my shoulder to show she was glad to see
      me. Strickland had contrived to claw together a sort of meal which he
      called lunch, and immediately after it was finished went out about his
      business. I was left alone with Tietjens and my own affairs. The heat of
      the summer had broken up and turned to the warm damp of the rains. There
      was no motion in the heated air, but the rain fell like ramrods on the
      earth, and flung up a blue mist when it splashed back. The bamboos, and
      the custard-apples, the poinsettias, and the mango-trees in the garden
      stood still while the warm water lashed through them, and the frogs began
      to sing among the aloe hedges. A little before the light failed, and when
      the rain was at its worst, I sat in the back verandah and heard the water
      roar from the eaves, and scratched myself because I was covered with the
      thing called prickly-heat. Tietjens came out with me and put her head in
      my lap and was very sorrowful; so I gave her biscuits when tea was ready,
      and I took tea in the back verandah on account of the little coolness
      found there. The rooms of the house were dark behind me. I could smell
      Strickland&rsquo;s saddlery and the oil on his guns, and I had no desire to sit
      among these things. My own servant came to me in the twilight, the muslin
      of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched body, and told me that a
      gentleman had called and wished to see some one. Very much against my
      will, but only because of the darkness of the rooms, I went into the naked
      drawing-room, telling my man to bring the lights. There might or might not
      have been a caller waiting&mdash;-it seemed to me that I saw a figure by
      one of the windows&mdash;-but when the lights came there was nothing save
      the spikes of the rain without, and the smell of the drinking earth in my
      nostrils. I explained to my servant that he was no wiser than he ought to
      be, and went back to the verandah to talk to Tietjens. She had gone out
      into the wet, and I could hardly coax her back to me; even with biscuits
      with sugar tops. Strickland came home, dripping wet, just before dinner,
      and the first thing he said was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has any one called?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained, with apologies, that my servant had summoned me into the
      drawing-room on a false alarm; or that some loafer had tried to call on
      Strickland, and thinking better of it had fled after giving his name.
      Strickiand ordered dinner, without comment, and since it was a real dinner
      with a white tablecloth attached, we sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock Strickland wanted to go to bed, and I was tired too.
      Tietjens, who had been lying underneath the table, rose up, and swung into
      the least exposed verandah as soon as her master moved to his own room,
      which was next to the stately chamber set apart for Tietjens. If a mere
      wife had wished to sleep out of doors in that pelting rain it would not
      have mattered; but Tietjens was a dog, and therefore the better animal. I
      looked at Strickland, expecting to see him flay her with a whip. He smiled
      queerly, as a man would smile after telling some unpleasant domestic
      tragedy. &lsquo;She has done this ever since I moved in here,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Let her
      go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was Strickland&rsquo;s dog, so I said nothing, but I felt all that
      Strickland felt In being thus made light of. Tietjens encamped outside my
      bedroom window, and storm after storm came up, thundered on the thatch,
      and died away. The lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spatters a
      barn-door, but the light was pale blue, not yellow; and, looking through
      my split bamboo blinds, I could see the great dog standing, not sleeping,
      in the verandah, the hackles alift on her back and her feet anchored as
      tensely as the drawn wire-rope of a suspension bridge. In the very short
      pauses of the thunder I tried to sleep, but it seemed that some one wanted
      me very urgently. He, whoever he was, was trying to call me by name, but
      his voice was no more than a husky whisper. The thunder ceased, and
      Tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon. Somebody tried
      to open my door, walked about and about through the house and stood
      breathing heavily in the verandahs, and just when I was falling asleep I
      fancied that I heard a wild hammering and clamouring above my head or on
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran into Strickland&rsquo;s room and asked him whether he was ill, and had
      been calling for me. He was lying on his bed half dressed, a pipe in his
      mouth. &lsquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Have I been walking round the
      house recently?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained that he had been tramping in the dining-room and the
      smoking-room and two or three other places, and he laughed and told me to
      go back to bed. I went back to bed and slept till the morning, but through
      all my mixed dreams I was sure I was doing some one an injustice in not
      attending to his wants. What those wants were I could not tell; but a
      fluttering, whispering, bolt-fumbling, lurking, loitering Someone was
      reproaching me for my slackness, and, half awake, I heard the howling of
      Tietjens in the garden and the threshing of the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lived in that house for two days. Strickland went to his office daily,
      leaving me alone for eight or ten hours with Tietjens for my only
      companion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable, and so was
      Tietjens; but in the twilight she and I moved into the back verandah and
      cuddled each other for company. We were alone in the house, but none the
      less it was much too fully occupied by a tenant with whom I did not wish
      to interfere. I never saw him, but I could see the curtains between the
      rooms quivering where he had just passed through; I could hear the chairs
      creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had just quitted them;
      and I could feel when I went to get a book from the dining-room that
      somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front verandah till I should
      have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more interesting by glaring
      into the darkened rooms with every hair erect, and following the motions
      of something that I could not see. She never entered the rooms, but her
      eyes moved interestedly: that was quite sufficient. Only when my servant
      came to trim the lamps and make all light and habitable she would come in
      with me and spend her time sitting on her haunches, watching an invisible
      extra man as he moved about behind my shoulder. Dogs are cheerful
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained to Strickland, gently as might be, that I would go over to the
      Club and find for myself quarters there. I admired his hospitality, was
      pleased with his guns and rods, but I did not much care for his house and
      its atmosphere. He heard me out to the end, and then smiled very wearily,
      but without contempt, for he is a man who understands things. &lsquo;Stay on,&rsquo; 
      he said, &lsquo;and see what this thing means. All you have talked about I have
      known since I took the bungalow. Stay on and wait. Tietjens has left me.
      Are you going too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen him through one little affair, connected with a heathen idol,
      that had brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum, and I had no desire
      to help him through further experiences. He was a man to whom
      unpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I explained more clearly than ever that I liked him immensely,
      and would be happy to see him in the daytime; but that I did not care to
      sleep under his roof. This was after dinner, when Tietjens had gone out to
      lie in the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; said Strickland, with his eyes on the
      ceiling-cloth. &lsquo;Look at that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tails of two brown snakes were hanging between the cloth and the
      cornice of the wall. They threw long shadows in the lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are afraid of snakes of course&mdash;&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate and fear snakes, because if you look into the eyes of any snake you
      will see that it knows all and more of the mystery of man&rsquo;s fall, and that
      it feels all the contempt that the Devil felt when Adam was evicted from
      Eden. Besides which its bite is generally fatal, and it twists up trouser
      legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to get your thatch overhauled,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me a mahseer-rod, and we&rsquo;ll poke &lsquo;em down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll hide among the roof-beams,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand
      snakes overhead. I&rsquo;m going up into the roof. If I shake &lsquo;em down, stand by
      with a cleaning-rod and break their backs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not anxious to assist Strickland in his work, but I took the
      cleaning-rod and waited in the dining-room, while Strickland brought a
      gardener&rsquo;s ladder from the verandah, and set it against the side of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snake-tails drew themselves up and disappeared. We could hear the dry
      rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy ceiling-cloth.
      Strickland took a lamp with him, while I tried to make clear to him the
      danger of hunting roof-snakes between a ceiling-cloth and a thatch, apart
      from the deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceiling-cloths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re sure to hide near the walls by the
      cloth. The bricks are too cold for &lsquo;em, and the heat of the room is just
      what they like.&rsquo; He put his hand to the corner of the stuff and ripped it
      from the cornice. It gave with a great sound of tearing, and Strickland
      put his head through the opening into the dark of the angle of the
      roof-beams. I set my teeth and lifted the rod, for I had not the least
      knowledge of what might descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; said Strickland, and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof.
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s room for another set of rooms up here, and, by Jove, some one is
      occupying &lsquo;em!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snakes?&rsquo; I said from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. It&rsquo;s a buffalo. Hand me up the two last joints of a mahseer-rod, and
      I&rsquo;ll prod it. It&rsquo;s lying on the main roof-beam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed up the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a nest for owls and serpents! No wonder the snakes live here,&rsquo; said
      Strickland, climbing farther into the roof. I could see his elbow
      thrusting with the rod. &lsquo;Come out of that, whoever you are! Heads below
      there! It&rsquo;s falling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the ceiling-cloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a shape
      that was pressing it downwards and downwards towards the lighted lamp on
      the table. I snatched the lamp out of danger and stood back. Then the
      cloth ripped out from the walls, tore, split, swayed, and shot down upon
      the table something that I dared not look at, till Strickland had slid
      down the ladder and was standing by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not say much, being a man of few words; but he picked up the loose
      end of the tablecloth and threw it over the remnants on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me,&rsquo; said he, putting down the lamp, &lsquo;our friend Imray has
      come back. Oh! you would, would you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement under the cloth, and a little snake wriggled out, to
      be back-broken by the butt of the mahseer-rod. I was sufficiently sick to
      make no remarks worth recording.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland meditated, and helped himself to drinks. The arrangement under
      the cloth made no more signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it Imray?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland turned back the cloth for a moment, and looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is Imray,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and his throat is cut from ear to ear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we spoke, both together and to ourselves: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why he whispered
      about the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tietjens, in the garden, began to bay furiously. A little later her great
      nose heaved open the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sniffed and was still. The tattered ceiling-cloth hung down almost to
      the level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away from the
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tietjens came in and sat down; her teeth bared under her lip and her
      forepaws planted. She looked at Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business, old lady,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Men don&rsquo;t climb up into the
      roofs of their bungalows to die, and they don&rsquo;t fasten up the ceiling
      cloth behind &lsquo;em. Let&rsquo;s think it out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s think it out somewhere else,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellent idea! Turn the lamps out. We&rsquo;ll get into my room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not turn the lamps out. I went into Strickland&rsquo;s room first, and
      allowed him to make the darkness. Then he followed me, and we lit tobacco
      and thought. Strickland thought. I smoked furiously, because I was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imray is back,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;The question is&mdash;-who killed
      Imray? Don&rsquo;t talk, I&rsquo;ve a notion of my own. When I took this bungalow I
      took over most of Imray&rsquo;s servants. Imray was guileless and inoffensive,
      wasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I agreed; though the heap under the cloth had looked neither one thing nor
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I call in all the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie
      like Aryans. What do you suggest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call &lsquo;em in one by one,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll run away and give the news to all their fellows,&rsquo; said
      Strickland. &lsquo;We must segregate &lsquo;em. Do you suppose your servant knows
      anything about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may, for aught I know; but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely. He has only been
      here two or three days,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your notion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t quite tell. How the dickens did the man get the wrong side of the
      ceiling-cloth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a heavy coughing outside Strickland&rsquo;s bedroom door. This showed
      that Bahadur Khan, his body-servant, had waked from sleep and wished to
      put Strickland to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very warm night, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bahadur Khan, a great, green-turbaned, six-foot Mahomedan, said that it
      was a very warm night; but that there was more rain pending, which, by his
      Honour&rsquo;s favour, would bring relief to the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be so, if God pleases,&rsquo; said Strickland, tugging off his boots.
      &lsquo;It is in my mind, Bahadur Khan, that I have worked thee remorselessly for
      many days&mdash;-ever since that time when thou first earnest into my
      service. What time was that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has the Heaven-born forgotten? It was when Imray Sahib went secretly to
      Europe without warning given; and I-even I-came into the honoured service
      of the protector of the poor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Imray Sahib went to Europe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so said among those who were his servants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And thou wilt take service with him when he returns?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly, Sahib. He was a good master, and cherished his dependants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true. I am very tired, but I go buck-shooting to-morrow. Give me
      the little sharp rifle that I use for black-buck; it is in the case
      yonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stooped over the case; handed barrels, stock, and fore-end to
      Strickland, who fitted all together, yawning dolefully. Then he reached
      down to the gun-case, took a solid-drawn cartridge, and slipped it into
      the breech of the &lsquo;360 Express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Imray Sahib has gone to Europe secretly! That is very strange,
      Bahadur Khan, is it not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I know of the ways of the white man. Heaven-born?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very little, truly. But thou shalt know more anon. It has reached me that
      Imray Sahib has returned from his so long journeyings, and that even now
      he lies in the next room, waiting his servant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sahib!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamplight slid along the barrels of the rifle as they levelled
      themselves at Bahadur Khan&rsquo;s broad breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go and look!&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;Take a lamp. Thy master is tired, and he
      waits thee. Go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man picked up a lamp, and went into the dining-room, Strickland
      following, and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle. He looked
      for a moment at the black depths behind the ceiling-cloth; at the writhing
      snake under foot; and last, a gray glaze settling on his face, at the
      thing under the tablecloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hast thou seen?&rsquo; said Strickland after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen. I am clay in the white man&rsquo;s hands. What does the Presence
      do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang thee within the month. What else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For killing him? Nay, Sahib, consider. Walking among us, his servants, he
      cast his eyes upon my child, who was four years old. Him he bewitched, and
      in ten days he died of the fever&mdash;my child!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What said Imray Sahib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said he was a handsome child, and patted him on the head; wherefore my
      child died. Wherefore I killed Imray Sahib in the twilight, when he had
      come back from office, and was sleeping. Wherefore I dragged him up into
      the roof-beams and made all fast behind him. The Heaven-born knows all
      things. I am the servant of the Heaven-born.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Strickland looked at me above the rifle, and said, in the vernacular,
      &lsquo;Thou art witness to this saying? He has killed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bahadur Khan stood ashen gray in the light of the one lamp. The need for
      justification came upon him very swiftly. &lsquo;I am trapped,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
      the offence was that man&rsquo;s. He cast an evil eye upon my child, and I
      killed and hid him. Only such as are served by devils,&rsquo; he glared at
      Tietjens, couched stolidly before him, &lsquo;only such could know what I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was clever. But thou shouldst have lashed him to the beam with a rope.
      Now, thou thyself wilt hang by a rope. Orderly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A drowsy policeman answered Strickland&rsquo;s call. He was followed by another,
      and Tietjens sat wondrous still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take him to the police-station,&rsquo; said Strickland. &lsquo;There is a case
      toward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I hang, then?&rsquo; said Bahadur Khan, making no attempt to escape, and
      keeping his eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the sun shines or the water runs&mdash;yes!&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bahadur Khan stepped back one long pace, quivered, and stood still. The
      two policemen waited further orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; said Strickland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay; but I go very swiftly,&rsquo; said Bahadur Khan. &lsquo;Look! I am even now a
      dead man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his foot, and to the little toe there clung the head of the
      half-killed snake, firm fixed in the agony of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I come of land-holding stock,&rsquo; said Bahadur Khan, rocking where he stood.
      &lsquo;It were a disgrace to me to go to the public scaffold: therefore I take
      this way. Be it remembered that the Sahib&rsquo;s shirts are correctly
      enumerated, and that there is an extra piece of soap in his washbasin. My
      child was bewitched, and I slew the wizard. Why should you seek to slay me
      with the rope? My honour is saved, and&mdash;and&mdash;I die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour he died, as they die who are bitten by the little
      brown karait, and the policemen bore him and the thing under the
      tablecloth to their appointed places. All were needed to make clear the
      disappearance of Imray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Strickland, very calmly, as he climbed into bed, &lsquo;is called
      the nineteenth century. Did you hear what that man said?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Imray made a mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Simply and solely through not knowing the nature of the Oriental, and the
      coincidence of a little seasonal fever. Bahadur Khan had been with him for
      four years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered. My own servant had been with me for exactly that length of
      time. When I went over to my own room I found my man waiting, impassive as
      the copper head on a penny, to pull off my boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has befallen Bahadur Khan?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was bitten by a snake and died. The rest the Sahib knows,&rsquo; was the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how much of this matter hast thou known?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As much as might be gathered from One coming in in the twilight to seek
      satisfaction. Gently, Sahib. Let me pull off those boots.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just settled to the sleep of exhaustion when I heard Strickland
      shouting from his side of the house&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tietjens has come back to her place!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she had. The great deerhound was couched statelily on her own
      bedstead on her own blanket, while, in the next room, the idle, empty,
      ceiling-cloth waggled as it trailed on the table.

      NAMGAY DOOLA
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,
 The dew on his wet robe hung heavy and chill;
 Ere the steamer that brought him had passed out of hearin&rsquo;,
 He was Alderman Mike inthrojuicin&rsquo; a bill!
                       AMERICAN SONG.
</pre>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a King who lived on the road to Thibet, very
      many miles in the Himalayas. His Kingdom was eleven thousand feet above
      the sea and exactly four miles square; but most of the miles stood on end
      owing to the nature of the country. His revenues were rather less than
      four hundred pounds yearly, and they were expended in the maintenance of
      one elephant and a standing army of five men. He was tributary to the
      Indian Government, who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of
      the Himalaya-Thibet road in repair. He further increased his revenues by
      selling timber to the railway-companies; for he would cut the great deodar
      trees in his one forest, and they fell thundering into the Sutlej river
      and were swept down to the plains three hundred miles away and became
      railway-ties. Now and again this King, whose name does not matter, would
      mount a ringstraked horse and ride scores of miles to Simla-town to confer
      with the Lieutenant-Governor on matters of state, or to assure the Viceroy
      that his sword was at the service of the Queen-Empress. Then the Viceroy
      would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded, and the ringstraked horse and
      the cavalry of the State&mdash;-two men in tatters&mdash;and the herald
      who bore the silver stick before the King would trot back to their own
      place, which lay between the tail of a heaven-climbing glacier and a dark
      birch-forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, from such a King, always remembering that he possessed one veritable
      elephant, and could count his descent for twelve hundred years, I
      expected, when it was my fate to wander through his dominions, no more
      than mere license to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had closed in rain, and rolling clouds blotted out the lights of
      the villages in the valley. Forty miles away, untouched by cloud or storm,
      the white shoulder of Donga Pa&mdash;the Mountain of the Council of the
      Gods&mdash;upheld the Evening Star. The monkeys sang sorrowfully to each
      other as they hunted for dry roosts in the fern-wreathed trees, and the
      last puff of the day-wind brought from the unseen villages the scent of
      damp wood-smoke, hot cakes, dripping undergrowth, and rotting pine-cones.
      That is the true smell of the Himalayas, and if once it creeps into the
      blood of a man, that man will at the last, forgetting all else, return to
      the hills to die. The clouds closed and the smell went away, and there
      remained nothing in all the world except chilling white mist and the boom
      of the Sutlej river racing through the valley below. A fat-tailed sheep,
      who did not want to die, bleated piteously at my tent door. He was
      scuffling with the Prime Minister and the Director-General of Public
      Education, and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants. I expressed
      my thanks suitably, and asked if I might have audience of the King. The
      Prime Minister readjusted his turban, which had fallen off in the
      struggle, and assured me that the King would be very pleased to see me.
      Therefore I despatched two bottles as a foretaste, and when the sheep had
      entered upon another incarnation went to the King&rsquo;s Palace through the
      wet. He had sent his army to escort me, but the army stayed to talk with
      my cook. Soldiers are very much alike all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Palace was a four-roomed and whitewashed mud and timber house, the
      finest in all the hills for a day&rsquo;s journey. The King was dressed in a
      purple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban
      of price. He gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the
      palace courtyard which was occupied by the Elephant of State. The great
      beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail, and the curve of his
      back stood out grandly against the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister and the Director-General of Public Education were
      present to introduce me, but all the court had been dismissed, lest the
      two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The King cast a wreath
      of heavy-scented flowers round my neck as I bowed, and inquired how my
      honoured presence had the felicity to be. I said that through seeing his
      auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned into sunshine,
      and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good deeds would be
      remembered by the Gods. He said that since I had set my magnificent foot
      in his Kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy per cent more than
      the average. I said that the fame of the King had reached to the four
      corners of the earth, and that the nations gnashed their teeth when they
      heard daily of the glories of his realm and the wisdom of his moon-like
      Prime Minister and lotus-like Director-General of Public Education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the King&rsquo;s right
      hand. Three minutes later he was telling me that the state of the maize
      crop was something disgraceful, and that the railway-companies would not
      pay him enough for his timber. The talk shifted to and fro with the
      bottles, and we discussed very many stately things, and the King became
      confidential on the subject of Government generally. Most of all he dwelt
      on the shortcomings of one of his subjects, who, from all I could gather,
      had been paralyzing the executive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the old days,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;I could have ordered the Elephant
      yonder to trample him to death. Now I must e&rsquo;en send him seventy miles
      across the hills to be tried, and his keep would be upon the State. The
      Elephant eats everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What be the man&rsquo;s crimes, Rajah Sahib?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Firstly, he is an outlander and no man of mine own people. Secondly,
      since of my favour I gave him land upon his first coming, he refuses to
      pay revenue. Am I not the lord of the earth, above and below, entitled by
      right and custom to one-eighth of the crop? Yet this devil, establishing
      himself, refuses to pay a single tax; and he brings a poisonous spawn of
      babes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cast him into jail,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sahib,&rsquo; the King answered, shifting a little on the cushions, &lsquo;once and
      only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I was not
      able to go abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I would never
      again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of God; for I
      perceived the nature of the punishment. How can I break my vow? Were it
      only the lopping of a hand or a foot I should not delay. But even that is
      impossible now that the English have rule. One or another of my people&rsquo;&mdash;he
      looked obliquely at the Director-General of Public Education&mdash;&lsquo;would
      at once write a letter to the Viceroy, and perhaps I should be deprived of
      my ruffle of drums.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain amber
      mouthpiece, and passed his pipe to me. &lsquo;Not content with refusing
      revenue,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;this outlander refuses also the begar&rsquo; (this was
      the corvee or forced labour on the roads) &lsquo;and stirs my people up to the
      like treason. Yet he is, when he wills, an expert log-snatcher. There is
      none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when
      the logs stick fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he worships strange Gods,&rsquo; said the Prime Minister deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For that I have no concern,&rsquo; said the King, who was as tolerant as Akbar
      in matters of belief. &lsquo;To each man his own God and the fire or Mother
      Earth for us all at last. It is the rebellion that offends me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King has an army,&rsquo; I suggested. &lsquo;Has not the King burned the man&rsquo;s
      house and left him naked to the night dews?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, a hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once, I sent my
      army against him when his excuses became wearisome: of their heads he
      brake three across the top with a stick. The other two men ran away. Also
      the guns would not shoot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old
      muzzle-loading fowling-piece, with a ragged rust-hole where the nipples
      should have been, one-third a wire-bound matchlock with a worm-eaten
      stock, and one-third a four-bore flint duck-gun without a flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is to be remembered,&rsquo; said the King, reaching out for the bottle,
      &lsquo;that he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry face. What
      shall I do to him, Sahib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused taxes
      to their king as revenues to their Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it be the King&rsquo;s permission,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I will not strike my tents till
      the third day and I will see this man. The mercy of the King is God-like,
      and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover, both the
      bottles and another be empty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have my leave to go,&rsquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning a crier went through the state proclaiming that there was a
      log-jam on the river and that it behoved all loyal subjects to remove it.
      The people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley of
      poppy-fields; and the King and I went with them. Hundreds of dressed
      deodar-logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the river was bringing down
      more logs every minute to complete the blockade. The water snarled and
      wrenched and worried at the timber, and the population of the state began
      prodding the nearest logs with a pole in the hope of starting a general
      movement. Then there went up a shout of &lsquo;Namgay Doola! Namgay Doola!&rsquo; and
      a large red-haired villager hurried up, stripping off his clothes as he
      ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is he. That is the rebel,&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;Now will the dam be
      cleared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why has he red hair?&rsquo; I asked, since red hair among hill-folks is as
      common as blue or green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is an outlander,&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;Well done! Oh well done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Namgay Doola had scrambled out on the jam and was clawing out the butt of
      a log with a rude sort of boat-hook. It slid forward slowly as an
      alligator moves, three or four others followed it, and the green water
      spouted through the gaps they had made. Then the villagers howled and
      shouted and scrambled across the logs, pulling and pushing the obstinate
      timber, and the red head of Namgay Doola was chief among them all. The
      logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from upstream
      battered the now weakening dam. All gave way at last in a smother of foam,
      racing logs, bobbing black heads and confusion indescribable. The river
      tossed everything before it. I saw the red head go down with the last
      remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree-trunks.
      It rose close to the bank and blowing like a grampus. Namgay Doola wrung
      the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the King. I had time to
      observe him closely. The virulent redness of his shock head and beard was
      most startling; and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones
      shone two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an outlander, but yet a
      Thibetan in language, habit, and attire. He spoke the Lepcha dialect with
      an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was not so much a lisp as
      an accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whence comest thou?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Thibet.&rsquo; He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin went
      straight to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay Doola
      shook it. No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of the
      gesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed back to
      his village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar. It
      was the whooping of Namgay Doola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see now,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;why I would not kill him. He is a bold man
      among my logs, but,&rsquo; and he shook his head like a schoolmaster, &lsquo;I know
      that before long there will be complaints of him in the court. Let us
      return to the Palace and do justice.&rsquo; It was that King&rsquo;s custom to judge
      his subjects every day between eleven and three o&rsquo;clock. I saw him decide
      equitably in weighty matters of trespass, slander, and a little
      wife-stealing. Then his brow clouded and he summoned me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Again it is Namgay Doola,&rsquo; he said despairingly. &lsquo;Not content with
      refusing revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an oath
      to the like treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me! Nor are my
      taxes heavy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear, advanced
      trembling. He had been in the conspiracy, but had told everything and
      hoped for the King&rsquo;s favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O King,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if it be the King&rsquo;s will let this matter stand over
      till the morning. Only the Gods can do right swiftly, and it may be that
      yonder villager has lied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks let
      the matter remain. Wilt thou speak harshly to this red-headed outlander?
      He may listen to thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could not
      keep my countenance. Namgay Doola grinned persuasively, and began to tell
      me about a big brown bear in a poppy-field by the river. Would I care to
      shoot it? I spoke austerely on the sin of conspiracy, and the certainty of
      punishment. Namgay Doola&rsquo;s face clouded for a moment. Shortly afterwards
      he withdrew from my tent, and I heard him singing to himself softly among
      the pines. The words were unintelligible to me, but the tune, like his
      liquid insinuating speech, seemed the ghost of something strangely
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dir hane mard-i-yemen dir To weeree ala gee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      sang Namgay Doola again and again, and I racked my brain for that lost
      tune. It was not till after dinner that I discovered some one had cut a
      square foot of velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made
      me so angry that I wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big
      brown bear. I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the
      poppy-field, and I waited shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to
      catch him after his meal. The moon was at full and drew out the rich scent
      of the tasselled crop. Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan
      cow, one of the little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs.
      Two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me. I was in
      act to fire when I saw that they had each a brilliant red head. The lesser
      animal was trailing some rope behind it that left a dark track on the
      path. They passed within six feet of me, and the shadow of the moonlight
      lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly the word, for by
      all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my
      camera-cloth! I marvelled and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the Kingdom was in uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had gone
      forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow
      belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was
      sacrilege unspeakable against the Holy Cow. The State desired his blood,
      but he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with
      big stones, and defied the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King and I and the populace approached the hut cautiously. There was
      no hope of capturing the man without loss of life, for from a hole in the
      wall projected the muzzle of an extremely well-cared-for gun&mdash;the
      only gun in the State that could shoot. Namgay Doola had narrowly missed a
      villager just before we came up. The Standing Army stood. It could do no
      more, for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the windows. To
      these were added from time to time showers of scalding water. We saw red
      heads bobbing up and down in the hut. The family of Namgay Doola were
      aiding their sire, and blood-curdling yells of defiance were the only
      answers to our prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said the King, puffing, &lsquo;has such a thing befallen my State. Next
      year I will certainly buy a little cannon.&rsquo; He looked at me imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there any priest in the Kingdom to whom he will listen?&rsquo; said I, for a
      light was beginning to break upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He worships his own God,&rsquo; said the Prime Minister. &lsquo;We can starve him
      out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the white man approach,&rsquo; said Namgay Doola from within. &lsquo;All others I
      will kill. Send me the white man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a Thibetan
      hut crammed with children. And every child had flaming red hair. A raw
      cow&rsquo;s-tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces of black velvet&mdash;my
      black velvet&mdash;rudely hacked into the semblance of masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned more winningly than ever. &lsquo;There is no shame,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I did
      but cut off the tail of that man&rsquo;s cow. He betrayed me. I was minded to
      shoot him, Sahib. But not to death. Indeed not to death. Only in the
      legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the King? Why at
      all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the God of my father I cannot tell,&rsquo; said Namgay Doola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who was thy father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same that had this gun.&rsquo; He showed me his weapon&mdash;a Tower musket
      bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honourable East India Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And thy father&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Timlay Doola,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;At the first, I being then a little child, it is
      in my mind that he wore a red coat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of that I have no doubt. But repeat the name of thy father thrice or four
      times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came.
      &lsquo;Thimla Dhula,&rsquo; said he excitedly. &lsquo;To this hour I worship his God.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I see that God?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a little while&mdash;at twilight time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rememberest thou aught of thy father&rsquo;s speech?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is long ago. But there is one word which he said often. Thus &ldquo;Shun.&rdquo;
       Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to our sides. Thus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so. And what was thy mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A woman of the hills. We be Lepchas of Darjeeling, but me they call an
      outlander because my hair is as thou seest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long
      parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close upon
      twilight&mdash;the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly, the red-headed
      brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid his
      gun against the wall, lighted a little oil lamp, and set it before a
      recess in the wall. Pulling aside a curtain of dirty cloth, he revealed a
      worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmet-badge of a long forgotten
      East India regiment. &lsquo;Thus did my father,&rsquo; he said, crossing himself
      clumsily. The wife and children followed suit. Then all together they
      struck up the wailing chant that I heard on the hillside&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Dir bane mard-i-yemen dir
 To weeree ala gee.
</pre>
    <p>
      I was puzzled no longer. Again and again they crooned, as if their hearts
      would break, their version of the chorus of the Wearing of the Green&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They&rsquo;re hanging men and women too, For the wearing of the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      A diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about eight
      years old, was watching me as he sang. I pulled out a rupee, held the coin
      between finger and thumb and looked&mdash;only looked&mdash;at the gun
      against the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread
      the face of the child. Never for an instant stopping the song, he held out
      his hand for the money, and then slid the gun to my hand. I might have
      shot Namgay Doola as he chanted. But I was satisfied. The blood-instinct
      of the race held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain across the recess.
      Angelus was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus my father sang. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and I do
      not know the purport of these words, but it may be that the God will
      understand. I am not of this people, and I will not pay revenue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that soul-compelling grin. &lsquo;What occupation would be to me between
      crop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. But these people do not
      understand.&rsquo; He picked the masks from the floor, and looked in my face as
      simply as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make these devilries?&rsquo; I
      said, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell. I am but a Lepcha of Darjeeling, and yet the stuff&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which thou hast stolen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, surely. Did I steal? I desired it so. The stuff&mdash;the stuff&mdash;what
      else should I have done with the stuff?&rsquo; He twisted the velvet between his
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the sin of maiming the cow&mdash;consider that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true; but oh, Sahib, that man betrayed me and I had no thought&mdash;but
      the heifer&rsquo;s tail waved in the moonlight and I had my knife. What else
      should I have done? The tail came off ere I was aware. Sahib, thou knowest
      more than I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Stay within the door. I go to speak to the King.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The population of the State were ranged on the hillsides. I went forth and
      spoke to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O King,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Touching this man there be two courses open to thy
      wisdom. Thou canst either hang him from a tree, he and his brood, till
      there remains no hair that is red within the land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;Why should I hurt the little children?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had poured out of the hut door and were making plump obeisance to
      everybody. Namgay Doola waited with his gun across his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or thou canst, discarding the impiety of the cow-maiming, raise him to
      honour in thy Army. He comes of a race that will not pay revenue. A red
      flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that
      glowing hair. Make him chief of the Army. Give him honour as may befall,
      and full allowance of work, but look to it, O King, that neither he nor
      his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward. Feed him with words and
      favour, and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of, and he
      will be a bulwark of defence. But deny him even a tuft of grass for his
      own. This is the nature that God has given him. Moreover he has brethren&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The State groaned unanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if his brethren come, they will surely fight with each other till
      they die; or else the one will always give information concerning the
      other. Shall he be of thy Army, O King? Choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King bowed his head, and I said, &lsquo;Come forth, Namgay Doola, and
      command the King&rsquo;s Army. Thy name shall no more be Namgay in the mouths of
      men, but Patsay Doola, for as thou hast said, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Namgay Doola, new christened Patsay Doola, son of Timlay Doola, which
      is Tim Doolan gone very wrong indeed, clasped the King&rsquo;s feet, cuffed the
      Standing Army, and hurried in an agony of contrition from temple to
      temple, making offerings for the sin of cattle-maiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the King was so pleased with my perspicacity, that he offered to sell
      me a village for twenty pounds sterling. But I buy no villages in the
      Himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the
      heaven-climbing glacier and the dark birch-forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that breed.

    <h2>
      BURTRAN AND BIMI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The orang-outang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheep-pen began the
      discussion. The night was stiflingly hot, and as I and Hans Breitmann, the
      big-beamed German, passed him, dragging our bedding to the fore-peak of
      the steamer, he roused himself and chattered obscenely. He had been caught
      somewhere in the Malayan Archipelago, and was going to England to be
      exhibited at a shilling a head. For four days he had struggled, yelled,
      and wrenched at the heavy bars of his prison without ceasing, and had
      nearly slain a lascar, incautious enough to come within reach of the great
      hairy paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be well for you, mine friend, if you was a liddle seasick,&rsquo; said
      Hans Breitmann, pausing by the cage.&rsquo; You haf too much Ego in your
      Cosmos.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The orang-outang&rsquo;s arm slid out negligently from between the bars. No one
      would have believed that it would make a sudden snakelike rush at the
      German&rsquo;s breast. The thin silk of the sleeping-suit tore out; Hans stepped
      back unconcernedly to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close to one of
      the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too much Ego,&rsquo; said he, peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged
      devil, who was rending the silk to tatters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we laid out our bedding in the bows among the sleeping Lascars, to
      catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us. The sea was like
      smoky oil, except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled
      back into the dark in smears of dull flame. There was a thunderstorm some
      miles away; we could see the glimmer of the lightning. The ship&rsquo;s cow,
      distressed by the heat and the smell of the ape-beast in the cage, lowed
      unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as that in which the
      look-out man answered the hourly call from the bridge. The trampling tune
      of the engines was very distinct, and the jarring of the ash-lift, as it
      was tipped into the sea, hurt the procession of hushed noise. Hans lay
      down by my side and lighted a good-night cigar. This was naturally the
      beginning of conversation. He owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the
      sea, and stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself; for his business
      in life was to wander up and down the world, collecting orchids and wild
      beasts and ethnological specimens for German and American dealers. I
      watched the glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom, as the
      sentences rose and fell, till I was nearly asleep. The orang-outang,
      troubled by some dream of the forests of his freedom, began to yell like a
      soul in purgatory, and to pluck madly at the bars of the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabout,&rsquo; said Hans
      lazily. &lsquo;He screams goot. See, now, how I shall tame him when he stops
      himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause in the outcry, and from Hans&rsquo; mouth came an imitation of
      a snake&rsquo;s hiss, so perfect that I almost sprang to my feet. The sustained
      murderous sound ran along the deck, and the wrenching at the bars ceased.
      The orang-outang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dot stopped him,&rsquo; said Hans. &lsquo;I learned dot trick in Mogoung Tanjong when
      I was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in Berlin. Efery one in
      der world is afraid of der monkeys&mdash;except der snake. So I blay snake
      against monkey, and he keep quite still. Dere was too much Ego in his
      Cosmos. Dot is der soul-custom of monkeys. Are you asleep, or will you
      listen, and I will tell a dale dot you shall not pelief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no tale in the wide world that I can&rsquo;t believe,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you haf learned pelief you haf learned somedings. Now I shall try your
      pelief. Goot! When I was collecting dose liddle monkeys&mdash;it was in
      &lsquo;79 or &lsquo;80, und I was in der islands of der Archipelago&mdash;over dere in
      der dark&rsquo;&mdash;he pointed southward to New Guinea generally&mdash;&lsquo;Mein
      Gott! I would sooner collect life red devils than liddle monkeys. When dey
      do not bite off your thumbs dey are always dying from nostalgia&mdash;home-sick&mdash;for
      dey haf der imperfect soul, which is midway arrested in defelopment&mdash;und
      too much Ego. I was dere for nearly a year, und dere I found a man dot was
      called Bertran. He was a Frenchman, und he was goot man&mdash;naturalist
      to his bone. Dey said he was an escaped convict, but he was naturalist,
      und dot was enough for me. He would call all der life beasts from der
      forest, und dey would come. I said he was St. Francis of Assizi in a new
      dransmigration produced, und he laughed und said he haf never preach to
      der fishes. He sold dem for tripang&mdash;beche-de-mer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Und dot man, who was king of beasts-tamer men, he had in der house shust
      such anoder as dot devil-animal in der cage&mdash;a great orang-outang dot
      thought he was a man. He haf found him when he was a child&mdash;der
      orang-outang&mdash;und he was child und brother und opera comique all
      round to Betran. He had his room in dot house&mdash;not a cage, but a room&mdash;mit
      a bed und sheets, und he would go to bed und get up in der morning und
      smoke his cigar und eat his dinner mit Bertran, und walk mit him hand in
      hand, which was most horrible. Herr Gott! I haf seen dot beast throw
      himself back in his chair und laugh when Bertran haf made fun of me. He
      was NOT a beast; he was a man, und he talked to Bertran, und Bertran
      comprehend, for I have seen dem. Und he was always politeful to me except
      when I talk too long to Bertran und say nodings at all to him. Den he
      would pull me away&mdash;dis great, dark devil, mit his enormous paws&mdash;shust
      as if I was a child. He was not a beast; he was a man. Dis I saw pefore I
      know him three months, und Bertran he haf saw the same; and Bimi, der
      orang-outang, haf understood us both, mit his cigar between his big
      dog-teeth und der blue gum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was dere a year, dere und at dere oder islands&mdash;somedimes for
      monkeys und somedimes for butterflies und orchits. One time Bertran says
      to me dot he will be married, because he haf found a girl dot was goot,
      und he enquire if this marrying idee was right. I would not say, pecause
      it was not me dot was going to be married. Den he go off courting der girl&mdash;she
      was a half-caste French girl&mdash;very pretty. Haf you got a new light
      for my cigar? Ouf! Very pretty. Only I say, &ldquo;Haf you thought of Bimi? If
      he pull me away when I talk to you, what will he do to your wife? He will
      pull her in pieces. If I was you, Bertran, I would gif my wife for
      wedding-present der stuff figure of Bimi.&rdquo; By dot time I had learned some
      dings about der monkey peoples. &ldquo;Shoot him?&rdquo; says Bertran. &ldquo;He is your
      beast,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;if he was mine he would be shot now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Den I felt at der back of my neck der fingers of Bimi. Mein Gott! I tell
      you dot he talked through dose fingers. It was der deaf-and-dumb alphabet
      all gomplete. He slide his hairy arm round my neck, und he tilt up my chin
      und looked into my face, shust to see if I understood his talk so well as
      he understood mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;See now dere!&rdquo; says Bertran, &ldquo;und you would shoot him while he is
      cuddlin&rsquo; you? Dot is der Teuton ingrate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I knew dot I had made Bimi a life&rsquo;s-enemy, pecause his fingers haf
      talk murder through the back of my neck. Next dime I see Bimi dere was a
      pistol in my belt, und he touched it once, und I open der breech to show
      him it was loaded. He haf seen der liddle monkeys killed in der woods: he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So Bertran he was married, and he forgot clean about Bimi dot was
      skippin&rsquo; alone on der beach mit der half of a human soul in his belly. I
      was see him skip, und he took a big bough und thrash der sand till he haf
      made a great hole like a grave. So I says to Bertran, &ldquo;For any sakes, kill
      Bimi. He is mad mit der jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bertran haf said &ldquo;He is not mad at all. He haf obey und lofe my wife, und
      if she speak he will get her slippers,&rdquo; und he looked at his wife agross
      der room. She was a very pretty girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Den I said to him, &ldquo;Dost dou pretend to know monkeys und dis beast dot is
      lashing himself mad upon der sands, pecause you do not talk to him? Shoot
      him when he comes to der house, for he haf der light in his eye dot means
      killing&mdash;und killing.&rdquo; Bimi come to der house, but dere was no light
      in his eye. It was all put away, cunning&mdash;so cunning&mdash;und he
      fetch der girl her slippers, und Bertran turn to me und say, &ldquo;Dost dou
      know him in nine months more dan I haf known him in twelve years? Shall a
      child stab his fader? I haf fed him, und he was my child. Do not speak
      this nonsense to my wife or to me any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dot next day Bertran came to my house to help me make some wood cases for
      der specimens, und he tell me dot he haf left his wife a liddle while mit
      Bimi in der garden. Den I finish my cases quick, und I say, &ldquo;Let us go to
      your houses und get a trink.&rdquo; He laugh and say, &ldquo;Come along, dry mans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His wife was not in der garden, und Bimi did not come when Bertran
      called. Und his wife did not come when he called, und he knocked at her
      bedroom door und dot was shut tight&mdash;locked. Den he look at me, und
      his face was white. I broke down der door mit my shoulder, und der thatch
      of der roof was torn into a great hole, und der sun came in upon der
      floor. Haf you ever seen paper in der waste-basket, or cards at whist on
      der table scattered? Dere was no wife dot could be seen. I tell you dere
      was nodings in dot room dot might be a woman. Dere was stuff on der floor
      und dot was all. I looked at dese things und I was very sick; but Bertran
      looked a liddle longer at what was upon the floor und der walls, und der
      hole in der thatch. Den he pegan to laugh, soft und low, und I knew und
      thank Gott dot he was mad. He nefer cried, he nefer prayed. He stood all
      still in der doorway und laugh to himself. Den he said, &ldquo;She haf locked
      herself in dis room, and he haf torn up der thatch. Fi donc! Dot is so. We
      will mend der thatch und wait for Bimi. He will surely come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you we waited ten days in dot house, after der room was made into
      a room again, und once or twice we saw Bimi comin&rsquo; a liddle way from der
      woods. He was afraid pecause he haf done wrong. Bertran called him when he
      was come to look on the tenth day, und Bimi come skipping along der beach
      und making noises, mit a long piece of black hair in his hands. Den
      Bertran laugh and say, &ldquo;Fi donc!&rdquo; shust as if it was a glass broken upon
      der table; und Bimi come nearer, und Bertran was honey-sweet in his voice
      und laughed to himself. For three days he made love to Bimi, pecause Bimi
      would not let himself be touched. Den Bimi come to dinner at der same
      table mit us, und the hair on his hands was all black und thick mit-mit
      what had dried on der hands. Bertran gave him sangaree till Bimi was drunk
      and stupid, und den&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans paused to puff at his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Und den Bertran he kill him mit his hands, und I go for a walk upon der
      beach. It was Bertran&rsquo;s own piziness. When I come back der ape he was
      dead, und Bertran he was dying abofe him; but still he laughed liddle und
      low und he was quite content. Now you know der formula of der strength of
      der orang-outang&mdash;it is more as seven to one in relation to man. But
      Bertran, he haf killed Bimi mit sooch dings as Gott gif him. Dot was der
      miracle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The infernal clamour in the cage recommenced. &lsquo;Aha! Dot friend of ours haf
      still too much Ego in his Cosmos. Be quiet, dou!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans hissed long and venomously. We could hear the great beast quaking in
      his cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why in the world didn&rsquo;t you help Bertran instead of letting him be
      killed?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; said Hans, composedly stretching himself to slumber, &lsquo;it was
      not nice even to mineself dot I should live after I haf seen dot room mit
      der hole in der thatch. Und Bertran, he was her husband. Goot-night, und&mdash;sleep
      well.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      MOTI GUJ&mdash;MUTINEER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who wished to clear
      some forest land for coffee-planting. When he had cut down all the trees
      and burned the under-wood the stumps still remained. Dynamite is expensive
      and slow-fire slow. The happy medium for stump-clearing is the lord of all
      beats, who is the elephant. He will either push the stump out of the
      ground with his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with ropes. The
      planter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and threes, and fell
      to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of
      all the drivers or mahouts; and the superior beast&rsquo;s name was Moti Guj. He
      was the absolute property of his mahout, which would never have been the
      case under native rule, for Moti Guj was a creature to be desired by
      kings; and his name, being translated, meant the Pearl Elephant. Because
      the British Government was in the land, Deesa, the mahout, enjoyed his
      property undisturbed. He was dissipated. When he had made much money
      through the strength of his elephant, he would get extremely drunk and
      give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg over the tender nails of the
      forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled the life out of Deesa on these
      occasions, for he knew that after the beating was over Deesa would embrace
      his trunk and weep and call him his love and his life and the liver of his
      soul, and give him some liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of liquor&mdash;arrack
      for choice, though he would drink palm-tree toddy if nothing better
      offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep between Moti Guj&rsquo;s forefeet, and as
      Deesa generally chose the middle of the public road, and as Moti Guj
      mounted guard over him and would not permit horse, foot, or cart to pass
      by, traffic was congested till Deesa saw fit to wake up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter&rsquo;s clearing: the wages
      were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj&rsquo;s neck and gave him orders,
      while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps&mdash;for he owned a magnificent pair
      of tusks; or pulled at the end of a rope&mdash;for he had a magnificent
      pair of shoulders, while Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he was
      the king of elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his three
      hundred pounds&rsquo; weight of green food with a quart of arrack, and Deesa
      would take a share and sing songs between Moti Guj&rsquo;s legs till it was time
      to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led Moti Guj down to the river, and Moti
      Guj lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows, while Deesa went over him
      with a coir-swab and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook the pounding blow of
      the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up and turn
      over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his feet, and examine his
      eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores or
      budding ophthalmia. After inspection, the two would &lsquo;come up with a song
      from the sea,&rsquo; Moti Guj all black and shining, waving a torn tree branch
      twelve feet long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his own long wet
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the desire
      to drink deep. He wished for an orgie. The little draughts that led
      nowhere were taking the manhood out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the planter, and &lsquo;My mother&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; said he, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She died on the last plantation two months ago; and she died once before
      that when you were working for me last year,&rsquo; said the planter, who knew
      something of the ways of nativedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to me,&rsquo; said
      Deesa, weeping more than ever. &lsquo;She has left eighteen small children
      entirely without bread, and it is I who must fill their little stomachs,&rsquo; 
      said Deesa, beating his head on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who brought you the news?&rsquo; said the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The post&rsquo; said Deesa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been a post here for the past week. Get back to your lines!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A devastating sickness has fallen on my village, and all my wives are
      dying,&rsquo; yelled Deesa, really in tears this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa&rsquo;s village,&rsquo; said the planter.&rsquo; Chihun,
      has this man a wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He!&rsquo; said Chihun. &lsquo;No. Not a woman of our village would look at him.
      They&rsquo;d sooner marry the elephant.&rsquo; Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and
      bellowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will get into a difficulty in a minute,&rsquo; said the planter.&rsquo; Go back
      to your work!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I will speak Heaven&rsquo;s truth&rsquo; gulped Deesa, with an inspiration. &lsquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t been drunk for two months. I desire to depart in order to get
      properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation. Thus I
      shall cause no trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A flickering smile crossed the planter&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Deesa,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve
      spoken the truth, and I&rsquo;d give you leave on the spot if anything could be
      done with Moti Guj while you&rsquo;re away. You know that he will only obey your
      orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May the Light of the Heavens live forty thousand years. I shall be absent
      but ten little days. After that, upon my faith and honour and soul, I
      return. As to the inconsiderable interval, have I the gracious permission
      of the Heaven-born to call up Moti Guj?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Permission was granted, and, in answer to Deesa&rsquo;s shrill yell, the lordly
      tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been
      squirting dust over himself till his master should return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Light of my heart, Protector of the Drunken, Mountain of Might, give
      ear,&rsquo; said Deesa, standing in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj gave ear, and saluted with his trunk. &lsquo;I am going away,&rsquo; said
      Deesa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his master. One could
      snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you, you fubsy old pig, must stay behind and work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He hated
      stump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be gone for ten days, O Delectable One. Hold up your near
      forefoot and I&rsquo;ll impress the fact upon it, warty toad of a dried
      mud-puddle.&rsquo; Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti Guj ten times on the
      nails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten days,&rsquo; said Deesa, &lsquo;you must work and haul and root trees as Chihun
      here shall order you. Take up Chihun and set him on your neck!&rsquo; Moti Guj
      curled the tip of his trunk, Chihun put his foot there and was swung on to
      the neck. Deesa handed Chihun the heavy ankus, the iron elephant-goad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chihun thumped Moti Guj&rsquo;s bald head as a paviour thumps a kerbstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj trumpeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be still, hog of the backwoods. Chihun&rsquo;s your mahout for ten days. And
      now bid me good-bye, beast after mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my king!
      Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the herd, preserve your honoured
      health; be virtuous. Adieu!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air twice.
      That was his way of bidding the man good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll work now,&rsquo; said Dessa to the planter. &lsquo;Have I leave to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti Guj went back to
      haul stumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn
      notwithstanding. Chihun gave him balls of spices, and tickled him under
      the chin, and Chihun&rsquo;s little baby cooed to him after work was over, and
      Chihun&rsquo;s wife called him a darling; but Moti Guj was a bachelor by
      instinct, as Deesa was. He did not understand the domestic emotions. He
      wanted the light of his universe back again&mdash;the drink and the
      drunken slumber, the savage beatings and the savage caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      None the less he worked well, and the planter wondered. Deesa had
      vagabonded along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own
      caste and, drinking, dancing, and tippling, had drifted past all knowledge
      of the lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned no Deesa. Moti
      Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint. He swung clear, looked
      round, shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away, as one having
      business elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hi! ho! Come back, you,&rsquo; shouted Chihun. &lsquo;Come back, and put me on your
      neck, Misborn Mountain. Return, Splendour of the Hillsides. Adornment of
      all India, heave to, or I&rsquo;ll bang every toe off your fat fore-foot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after him with a
      rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward, and Chihun knew
      what that meant, though he tried to carry it off with high words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None of your nonsense with me,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;To your pickets, Devil-son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hrrump!&rsquo; said Moti Guj, and that was all&mdash;that and the forebent
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for a toothpick,
      and strolled about the clearing, making jest of the other elephants, who
      had just set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came out with a
      dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid the white man the
      compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing
      and &lsquo;Hrrumping&rsquo; him into the verandah. Then he stood outside the house
      chuckling to himself, and shaking all over with the fun of it, as an
      elephant will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll thrash him,&rsquo; said the planter. &lsquo;He shall have the finest thrashing
      that ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve foot of chain
      apiece, and tell them to lay on twenty blows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kala Nag&mdash;which means Black Snake&mdash;and Nazim were two of the
      biggest elephants in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer
      the graver punishments, since no man can beat an elephant properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as they
      sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti Guj had
      never, in all his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped, and he did not
      intend to open new experiences. So he waited, weaving his head from right
      to left, and measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag&rsquo;s fat side where a
      blunt tusk would sink deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain was his
      badge of authority; but he judged it good to swing wide of Moti Guj at the
      last minute, and seem to appear as if he had brought out the chain for
      amusement. Nazim turned round and went home early. He did not feel
      fighting-fit that morning, and so Moti Guj was left standing alone with
      his ears cocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back to his
      inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work, and is not tied
      up, is not quite so manageable as an eighty-one ton gun loose in a heavy
      sea-way. He slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps
      were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning labour and the
      inalienable rights of elephants to a long &lsquo;nooning&rsquo;; and, wandering to and
      fro, thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown, when he returned to
      his pickets for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t work you shan&rsquo;t eat,&rsquo; said Chihun angrily. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a wild
      elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your jungle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Chihun&rsquo;s little brown baby, rolling on the floor of the hut, stretched its
      fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj knew well that it was
      the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung out his trunk with a
      fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby threw itself shouting
      upon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing
      in the air twelve feet above his father&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great Chief!&rsquo; said Chihun. &lsquo;Flour cakes of the best, twelve in number,
      two feet across, and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant, and two
      hundred pounds&rsquo; weight of fresh-cut young sugar-cane therewith. Deign only
      to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet, that
      could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun&rsquo;s hut, and waited for his
      food. He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj dozed, and
      thought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the elephant is
      that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives. Four or
      five hours in the night suffice&mdash;two just before midnight, lying down
      on one side; two just after one o&rsquo;clock, lying down on the other. The rest
      of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long
      grumbling soliloquies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a thought
      had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark
      forest with none to look after him. So all that night he chased through
      the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears. He went down
      to the river and blared across the shallows where Deesa used to wash him,
      but there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he disturbed all the
      elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to death some gypsies in the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk indeed,
      and he expected to fall into trouble for outstaying his leave. He drew a
      long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still
      uninjured; for he knew something of Moti Guj&rsquo;s temper; and reported
      himself with many lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for
      breakfast. His night exercise had made him hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call up your beast,&rsquo; said the planter, and Deesa shouted in the
      mysterious elephant-language, that some mahouts believe came from China at
      the birth of the world, when elephants and not men were masters. Moti Guj
      heard and came. Elephants do not gallop. They move from spots at varying
      rates of speed. If an elephant wished to catch an express train he could
      not gallop, but he could catch the train. Thus Moti Guj was at the
      planter&rsquo;s door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his pickets.
      He fell into Deesa&rsquo;s arms trumpeting with joy, and the man and beast wept
      and slobbered over each other, and handled each other from head to heel to
      see that no harm had befallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we will get to work,&rsquo; said Deesa. &lsquo;Lift me up, my son and my joy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moti Guj swung him up and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look for
      irksome stumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter was too astonished to be very angry.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
